Hi. My name is Raul and I am an individual passionate about building the decentralized web and contributing to a future where decentralized technology swings the pendulum back to the original promise of the Internet and empowers personal freedom.

Born and raised in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, I studied Computer Science at Harvard University, where I learned how important it is to harness the power of machines to build technology the world can benefit from.

I started a company called [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com) with my co-founder [Preston Van Loon](https://github.com/prestonvanloon) 
working on implementing the core of Ethereum blockchain protocol, including its major scalability upgrades using cutting-edge research such 
as Proof of Stake and Sharding. My team has received significant funding to achieve our vision. We have created a project 
named [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) fully open source as a Go implementation of Ethereum Proof of Stake. 
Today, our software is the most popular one to run the Ethereum blockchain, powering its consensus engine.

While at Harvard, I received the [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/): a $100k grant that allowed me to take off from school to pursue my passions. Thanks to the fellowship, I got into Ethereum and now I am a blockchain developer interested in building core improvements to the protocol.

My company, Prysmatic Labs, was acquired by [Offchain Labs](https://offchainlabs.com), the team behind the leading scaling solution for Ethereum called Arbitrum.

I am currently based in Atlanta, where I enjoy spending time in nature with my awesome wife Jiaqi and our cat, Buster.
