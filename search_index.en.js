Say you have some server that needs to do a bunch of different things while it runs, such as perform some backround jobs, update caches, handle several requests, expose a REST API, perform outbound requests to other APIs, all without blocking the main thread - what do you do? Typically, this is a good task for creating a microservices architecture where you have multiple applications talking to each other over some network service mesh, each containerized in some nice docker environment, orchestrated through something like Kubernetes or docker-compose.\n\n\nHowever, sometimes you just want a straightforward application that can do it all! A good example of this is a blockchain node, such as a Bitcoin or Ethereum node, which needs to do a bunch of things while it runs including:\n\nSyncing the blockchain\nExposing an RPC endpoint\nMining blocks, rewarding miners accordingly\nListening for p2p connections and handling the lifecycles of peers\nMaintaining an open database connection to some persistent key-value store such as Level-DB\n\nSome of the items above depend on each other, and they should all run when I start a single process for the node. How do we implement something like this in Go? This is a perfect use case for dependency injection. In this blog post, we're going to look at a simple pattern to get this done.\nFirst, our runtime is basically a series of services, each doing a bunch of things, asking for or sending data between each other, and possibly having errors or critical failures that we should easily be aware of from a bird's eye view. We want to ideally declare the services that should run upon starting the process, and should have a way of gracefully stopping them if the service dies. We can then define an interface called Service which lets us\n\nStart the process\nStop the process\nCheck the process' current status\n\nAnything that meets the criteria above is a service under our definition! We'll see why this is helpful below.\ntype Service interface {\n\t// Start spawns the main process done by the service.\n\tStart()\n\t// Stop terminates all processes belonging to the service,\n\t// blocking until they are all terminated.\n\tStop() error\n\t// Returns error if the service is not considered healthy.\n\tStatus() error\n}\n\nNext up, we're gonna define an actual struct that will keep track of services by their particular type. We keep around a map of services by their type, but we also keep around an ordered list of these types, given maps in Go do not have a set order. It's important for us to define an order of services, as services can often depend on others that should be initialized first.\n// ServiceRegistry provides a useful pattern for managing services.\n// It allows for ease of dependency management and ensures services\n// dependent on others use the same references in memory.\ntype ServiceRegistry struct {\n\tservices     map[reflect.Type]Service // map of types to services.\n\tserviceTypes []reflect.Type           // keep an ordered slice of registered service types.\n}\n\n// NewServiceRegistry starts a registry instance for convenience\nfunc NewServiceRegistry() *ServiceRegistry {\n\treturn &amp;ServiceRegistry{\n\t\tservices: make(map[reflect.Type]Service),\n\t}\n}\n\nNext up, we want to be able to register services into our registry in a particular order. If a service does not exist in the registry, we add it to the map and also to our ordered list of registered service types.\n// RegisterService appends a service constructor function to the service\n// registry.\nfunc (s *ServiceRegistry) RegisterService(service Service) error {\n\tkind := reflect.TypeOf(service)\n\tif _, exists := s.services[kind]; exists {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"service already exists: %v\", kind)\n\t}\n\ts.services[kind] = service\n\ts.serviceTypes = append(s.serviceTypes, kind)\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nNext up, we want to be able to actually start all our services in the order specified at the time of registration. Let's take a look:\n// StartAll initialized each service in order of registration.\nfunc (s *ServiceRegistry) StartAll() {\n\tlog.Infof(\"Starting %d services: %v\", len(s.serviceTypes), s.serviceTypes)\n\tfor _, kind := range s.serviceTypes {\n\t\tlog.Debugf(\"Starting service type %v\", kind)\n\t\tgo s.services[kind].Start()\n\t}\n}\n\nWe start each service in a goroutine so it does not block the main thread according to its specified .Start() method.\nWhen we wish to gracefully stop everything, and we call the .Stop() function for each service in reverse order of registration, checking for errors along the way.\n// StopAll ends every service in reverse order of registration, logging a\n// panic if any of them fail to stop.\nfunc (s *ServiceRegistry) StopAll() {\n\tfor i := len(s.serviceTypes) - 1; i &gt;= 0; i-- {\n\t\tkind := s.serviceTypes[i]\n\t\tservice := s.services[kind]\n\t\tif err := service.Stop(); err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Panicf(\"Could not stop the following service: %v, %v\", kind, err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nSo How Do We Use This?\nNow we have a cool way to do run multiple services from within a single application, how do we put it to use? Let's talk about a simple architecture!\nmygoproject/\n  p2p/\n    service.go\n  api/\n    service.go\n  db/\n    service.go\n  numbercrunching/\n    service.go \n\nWe register and start each service in the required order:\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n    registry := NewServiceRegistry()\n    \n    // Register our database first.\n    db := database.InitializeDB()\n    registry.RegisterService(db)\n    \n    // We then start up our p2p server.\n    p2pServer := p2p.InitializeP2P()\n    registry.RegisterService(p2pServer)\n\n    // We then start up our API.\n    apiServer := api.InitializeAPI()\n    registry.RegisterService(apiServer)\n\n    // We then start up some number crunching service.\n    miscServer := misc.InitializeNumberCrunching()\n    registry.RegisterService(miscServer)\n    \n    // Rev it up!\n    registry.StartAll()\n}\n\nDoes the code above do something...? What if my API server depends on the DB, what if my number cruncher depends on my API...? How can we we implement dependencies between services???\nEnter Dependency Injection\nThere's a reason we declared and registered each service in the order specified. That is, some services depend on others, and we want to keep the whole dependency graph quite simple. An important programming paradigm is the idea of separation of concerns, which means each module in a program should be concerned with its specific logic and shouldn't be tasked to do things outside of its logical scope. That is, you shouldn't expect your API server to also deal with the internals of handling the db connection, or with dialing other servers via a p2p peer manager. Everything should be self-contained, easy to reason about, and easier to test. \n\nA big part of separation of concerns in our toy example above is that each service shouldn't care about how to get access to other services. It should be provided its dependencies at the time of initialization. That is, if I'm the API server, I should just know I have access to the db and the p2p services, I shouldn't need to worry about how to request them fetch them from somewhere far away.\nThis concept of explicitly defining the dependencies and injecting them into services that need them is known as dependency injection, a fancy term that now makes more sense when you look at our code above. If you look at our API server code, it probably looks quite straighforward if we follow the service pattern above:\npackage api\n\ntype Server struct {\n    db *database.Database\n    p2pServer *p2p.Server\n}\n\nThe API Server doesn't need to worry about how to access the db or p2p services, as it already has them injected into it upon initialization! Pretty cool...but our service registry code doesn't allow for this injection just yet. Let's see how we can do it.\n\nDependency injection is awesome\n\n// FetchService takes in a struct pointer and sets the value of that pointer\n// to a service currently stored in the service registry. This ensures the input argument is\n// set to the right pointer that refers to the originally registered service.\nfunc (s *ServiceRegistry) FetchService(service interface{}) error {\n\tif reflect.TypeOf(service).Kind() != reflect.Ptr {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"input must be of pointer type, received value type instead: %T\", service)\n\t}\n\telement := reflect.ValueOf(service).Elem()\n\tif running, ok := s.services[element.Type()]; ok {\n\t\telement.Set(reflect.ValueOf(running))\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"unknown service: %T\", service)\n}\n\nThe fetch service function above is the key. It let's us grab the right pointer to a service we keep track of in our service registry. We can use this for dependency injection. \nLet's refactor our code to use it:\npackage main\n\nimport \"log\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    registry := NewServiceRegistry()\n    \n    // Register our database first.\n    db := database.InitializeDB()\n    registry.RegisterService(db)\n    \n    // We then start up our p2p server.\n    registerP2P(registry)\n\n    // We then start up our API.\n    registerAPI(registry)\n    \n    // Rev it up!\n    registry.StartAll()\n}\n\nfunc registerP2P(reg *ServiceRegistry) {\n    var dbService *database.Service\n    if err := reg.FetchService(&amp;dbService); err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    p2pServer := p2p.InitializeP2P(p2p.Config{\n        database: dbService, \n    })\n    registry.RegisterService(p2pServer)\n}\n\nfunc registerAPI(reg *ServiceRegistry) {\n    var dbService *database.Service\n    if err := reg.FetchService(&amp;dbService); err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    var p2pService *p2p.Server\n    if err := reg.FetchService(&amp;p2pService); err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    apiServer := api.InitializeAPI(api.Config{\n        database: dbService,\n        p2p: p2pService, \n    })\n    registry.RegisterService(apiServer)\n}\n\nThere we go! We explicitly define the dependencies each service needs upon initialization, making it easy for them to maintain autonomy and separation of concerns accordingly. Next time if you have to choose between creating a complex microservice architecture, consider this simple monolith with dependency injection to save you some headaches!\nWe actually use this exact same pattern in my team's Prysm project, our implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain Go you can find here.\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/building-a-service-registry-in-go/","title":"Building a Service Registry in Go"},"https://rauljordan.com/custom-static-analysis-in-go-part-1/":{"body":"\n(Credits to ScyllaDB)\nStatic analysis is the practice of examining source code in an automated way before code is run, typically to find bugs before they can even manifest. As a powerful programming language used in mission critical applications, Go also adds a lot of responsibility to its developers to write safe code. The risk of nil pointer panics, variable shadowing, and otherwise ignoring important errors can make an otherwise good looking program become an easy target for attacks or faults you never imagined could happen. \nHow this is different from using linters\nLinters, by definition, are already a type of static analyzers geared towards finding bad practices in your code among a set of accepted standards. Although linters provide a way to standardize your code according to a series of rules, there are some advanced edge cases that even linters cannot enforce, such as bugs which are specific to your application. For such edge cases, writing your own static analysis is your best bet. \nBy writing a static analysis tool, you can programmatically look through your own source code and enforce any rules you wish! In fact, Go makes static analysis very easy thanks to the golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis written by the Go team, giving us a ton of flexibility in terms of what we can do. We'll be using the standard library's analysis tools to look at important ways we can prevent our code from compiling with unsafe practices. The code for this blog post is available here on Github github.com/rauljordan/static-analysis.\nLet's first look at some prime examples of code which would benefit from static analysis, and are already caught by most major linters and tools such as go vet.\nChecking places in our code where we are not handling returned errors\nSometimes we forget to properly handle or propagate errors in our Go code:\nusers, _ := db.GetUsers()\nfor _, user := range users {\n\tfmt.Println(user.Name)\n}\n\nWe aren't handling the error above, and if users is nil due to an error from a call to db.GetUsers(), we'll have a nil pointer panic in the code above at runtime. This is a common candidate for static analysis, and is actually already a popular one included in the go vet tool known as errcheck.\nAccidental variable shadowing\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc test () (x int64, y int64) {\n\tx = 3\n\ty = 6\n\treturn\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar x int64 = 2\n\tfmt.Printf(\"x %v \\n\", x)\n\tx, y := test()\n \tfmt.Printf(\"x %v y %v \\n\", x, y)\n}\n\nOutput\nx 2 \nx 3 y 6 \n\nEven though we initialized a new variable y, there was no new x variable declared, but rather the original value was shadowed, which is a big bug risk and source of many problems in Go codebases. Checking for accidental variable shadowing is another common use case for static analysis.\nOur use case: enforcing file permission best practices in our application\nAt my company, we maintain an open source project called Prysm written in Go which is built to handle hundreds of millions of dollars, making it a prime target for attackers to steal from less tech savvy users, or users which may have unsafe configurations. In our particular application, we are writing sensitive files to a directory owned by the user. For this, we want to leverage unix file permissions to ensure any files only have read/write access from the user, and not from the group nor from other users on the same system.\nWhat we want to accomplish for our application is ensure we have read/write access to files for the current user only. As a sanity check, we can use the following useful tool permissions-calculator:\n\nUNIX Permissions use Octal notation, which you can read more about here. Based on the results of the calculator, permissions 0600 will accomplish our desired end-goal.\nMajor problem: the standard library makes dangerous assumptions\nThe Go standard library is great and packed with features. However, some of its useful ones such as os.MkdirAll and ioutil.WriteFile are dangerous if misused. Say we want to create a directory, such as myapplication/secrets/, we can write the following code to aid us:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"log\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Write with user only read/write/execute permissions.\n\tif err := os.MkdirAll(\"myapplication/secrets\", 0700); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Could not write directory: %v\", err)\n\t}\n}\n\nHowever, turns out the code above will complete without error if the directory already exists, even if it has different permissions. Let's write a test:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"testing\"\n)\n\nfunc TestMkdirAll_SilentFailure(t *testing.T) {\n\tdirPath := \"myapplication/secrets\"\n\tt.Cleanup(func() {\n\t\tif err := os.RemoveAll(dirPath); err != nil {\n\t\t\tt.Error(\"Could not remove directory\")\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\t// Evil attacker creates the directory ahead of time\n\t// with full 777 permissions.\n\tif err := os.MkdirAll(dirPath, 0777); err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Could not write directory: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\t// Now our application attempts to write to the directory\n\t// with 700 permissions to only allow current user read/write/exec.\n\tif err := os.MkdirAll(dirPath, 0700); err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Could not write directory: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tinfo, err := os.Stat(dirPath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\t// Check if other users have read permission.\n\tif info.Mode()&amp;(1&lt;&lt;2) != 0 {\n\t\tt.Error(\"Expected permissions only for user\")\n\t}\n}\n\nLet's run the test\n$ go test .\n--- FAIL: TestMkdirAll_SilentFailure (0.00s)\n    main_test.go:61: Expected permissions only for user\nFAIL\n\nYikes! No error here in the second call to os.MkdirAll, and even worse, the attacker was able to create a directory with the most open permissions possible, compromising the security assumptions of our application. What gives? For one, the standard library needs to make as few assumptions about desired default behavior, and turns out this assumption was the simplest they could make. Second, the same behavior is also found in the popular ioutil package's WriteFile function. Let's see:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"testing\"\n)\n\nfunc TestWriteFile_SilentFailure(t *testing.T) {\n\tdirPath := \"myapplication/secrets\"\n\tt.Cleanup(func() {\n\t\tif err := os.RemoveAll(dirPath); err != nil {\n\t\t\tt.Error(\"Could not remove directory\")\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\t// We create a directory with 777 permissions.\n\tif err := os.MkdirAll(dirPath, 0777); err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Could not write directory: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tsecretFile := filepath.Join(dirPath, \"credentials.txt\")\n\tif err := ioutil.WriteFile(secretFile, []byte(\"password\"), 0777); err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Could not write file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tif err := ioutil.WriteFile(secretFile, []byte(\"password\"), 0600); err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Could not write file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tinfo, err := os.Stat(secretFile)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\t// Check if other users have read permission.\n\tif info.Mode()&amp;(1&lt;&lt;2) != 0 {\n\t\tt.Error(\"Expected permissions only for user\")\n\t}\n}\n\nLet's run the test\n$ go test .\n--- FAIL: TestWriteFile_SilentFailure (0.00s)\n    main_test.go:61: Expected permissions only for user\nFAIL\n\nSame thing! We don't even get an error if we try to write to a file that was already compromised by an attacker with different permissions. It's clear these file writing utilities from the standard library are risky if you are writing a critical application, and we should instead use our own specific functions that properly check against this issue. For example, we can create our little package in our application called fileutil, where we create our own WriteFile and MkdirAll.\npackage fileutil\n\nfunc WriteFile(filename string, data []byte) error {\n\t// Make sure the file does not already exist with different permissions.\n\t...\n\t// Write a file with strict, 600 permissions (read/write for user only).\n\t...\n}\n\nfunc MkdirAll(dir string) error {\n\t// Make sure the directory does not already exist with different permissions.\n\t...\n\t// Write a directory with strict, 700 permissions (read/write/execute for user only).\n\t...\n}\n\nGreat, now we can just tell every developer in the company or contributors to our open source project to not use os nor ioutil but instead our own fileutil package, right? With a rapidly moving codebase, especially in open source code, this becomes next to impossible. We should instead make that part of our continuous integration suite by adding it into an existing static check tool such as go vet for the project to build at all if using the standard library's file writing utilities. This is where static analysis happens, making sure our program errors out before it even runs.\nApproach: static analysis to ensure safe file and dir writing\nThe goal or our static analyzer will be as follows:\n\nCheck if we are importing the os or io/ioutil package normally or as an alias\nCheck if function calls in our program use ioutil.WriteFile or os.MkdirAll, and raise issues\n\n// Package writefile implements a static analyzer to ensure that our project does not\n// use ioutil.MkdirAll or os.WriteFile as they are unsafe when it comes to guaranteeing\n// file permissions and not overriding existing permissions.\npackage writefile\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"go/ast\"\n\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/inspect\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector\"\n)\n\n// Doc explaining the tool.\nconst Doc = \"Tool to enforce usage of our own internal file-writing utils instead of os.MkdirAll or ioutil.WriteFile\"\n\nvar errUnsafePackage = errors.New(\n\t\"os and ioutil dir and file writing functions are not permissions-safe, use shared/fileutil\",\n)\n\n// Analyzer runs static analysis.\nvar Analyzer = &amp;analysis.Analyzer{\n\tName:     \"writefile\",\n\tDoc:      Doc,\n\tRequires: []*analysis.Analyzer{inspect.Analyzer},\n\tRun:      run,\n}\n\nfunc run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) {\n\nAbove, we define our imports, using the golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis package created by the language authors, and defining some important globals such as info about the analyzer and the error message we want to print out upon discovering the pattern searched for by the analyzer. To run the analyzer, we need a special syntax for our package, which will tell tools such as go vet how we should run this. Our package needs to expose an Analyzer struct, and a run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) function. Let's now use this to parse the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of our program.\nfunc run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) {\n\tinspect, ok := pass.ResultOf[inspect.Analyzer].(*inspector.Inspector)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"analyzer is not type *inspector.Inspector\")\n\t}\n\n\tnodeFilter := []ast.Node{\n\t\t(*ast.File)(nil),\n\t\t(*ast.ImportSpec)(nil),\n\t\t(*ast.CallExpr)(nil),\n\t}\n\n\taliases := make(map[string]string)\n\tdisallowedFns := []string{\"MkdirAll\", \"WriteFile\"}\n\nUsing the \"go/ast\" package, we can tell our inspector to filter out certain Go keywords, function calls, or imports. In this case, we want to retrieve either new go file definitions, go imports, and call expressions (fancy name for function calls). Additionally, we keep track of a map of aliases for imports and the disallowed functions our linter is checking for MkdirAll and WriteFile.\nfunc run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) {\n\t...\n\tinspect.Preorder(nodeFilter, func(node ast.Node) {\n\t\tswitch stmt := node.(type) {\n\t\tcase *ast.ImportSpec:\n\t\t\t...\n\t\tcase *ast.CallExpr:\n\t\t\t...\n\t\tcase *ast.File:\n\t\t\t...\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\treturn nil, nil\n}\n\nNext up, we actualy inspect our program and filter out nodes in the AST using our defined filters via the inspect.Preorder function, which gives us the ability to switch over the node types based on the filters we defined.\nFirst, if we see a Go import, we want to check if it is is \"os\" or \"io/ioutil\" and keep track of it by its defined name or just by their regular import name if aliased into an aliases map we defined.\n// Collect aliases.\npkg := stmt.Path.Value\nif pkg == \"\\\"os\\\"\" {\n\tif stmt.Name != nil {\n\t\taliases[stmt.Name.Name] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t} else {\n\t\taliases[\"os\"] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t}\n}\nif pkg == \"\\\"io/ioutil\\\"\" {\n\tif stmt.Name != nil {\n\t\taliases[stmt.Name.Name] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t} else {\n\t\taliases[\"ioutil\"] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t}\n}\n\nNext, if we see a call expression, which is just a function call, we check if it is part of the aliases map\nand if it is one of our disallowed functions:\nfor pkg, path := range aliases {\n\tfor _, fn := range disallowedFns {\n\t\t// Check if it is a dot imported package.\n\t\tif isPkgDot(stmt.Fun, pkg, fn) {\n\t\t\tpass.Reportf(\n\t\t\t\tnode.Pos(),\n\t\t\t\tfmt.Sprintf(\n\t\t\t\t\t\"%v: %s.%s() (from %s)\",\n\t\t\t\t\terrUnsafePackage,\n\t\t\t\t\tpkg,\n\t\t\t\t\tfn,\n\t\t\t\t\tpath,\n\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nIf this is the case, then we report on the analysis with our package defined error variable, letting the user know they should not be using those functions but instead, our own fileutil package. Here's the final result:\n// Package writefile implements a static analyzer to ensure our project does not\n// use ioutil.MkdirAll or os.WriteFile as they are unsafe when it comes to guaranteeing\n// file permissions and not overriding existing permissions.\npackage writefile\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"go/ast\"\n\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/inspect\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector\"\n)\n\n// Doc explaining the tool.\nconst Doc = \"Tool to enforce usage of our own file-writing utils instead of os.MkdirAll or ioutil.WriteFile\"\n\nvar errUnsafePackage = errors.New(\n\t\"os and ioutil dir and file writing functions are not permissions-safe, use shared/fileutil\",\n)\n\n// Analyzer runs static analysis.\nvar Analyzer = &amp;analysis.Analyzer{\n\tName:     \"writefile\",\n\tDoc:      Doc,\n\tRequires: []*analysis.Analyzer{inspect.Analyzer},\n\tRun:      run,\n}\n\nfunc run(pass *analysis.Pass) (interface{}, error) {\n\tinspect, ok := pass.ResultOf[inspect.Analyzer].(*inspector.Inspector)\n\tif !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"analyzer is not type *inspector.Inspector\")\n\t}\n\n\tnodeFilter := []ast.Node{\n\t\t(*ast.File)(nil),\n\t\t(*ast.ImportSpec)(nil),\n\t\t(*ast.CallExpr)(nil),\n\t}\n\n\taliases := make(map[string]string)\n\tdisallowedFns := []string{\"MkdirAll\", \"WriteFile\"}\n\n\tinspect.Preorder(nodeFilter, func(node ast.Node) {\n\t\tswitch stmt := node.(type) {\n\t\tcase *ast.File:\n\t\t\t// Reset aliases (per file).\n\t\t\taliases = make(map[string]string)\n\t\tcase *ast.ImportSpec:\n\t\t\t// Collect aliases.\n\t\t\tpkg := stmt.Path.Value\n\t\t\tif pkg == \"\\\"os\\\"\" {\n\t\t\t\tif stmt.Name != nil {\n\t\t\t\t\taliases[stmt.Name.Name] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\taliases[\"os\"] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif pkg == \"\\\"io/ioutil\\\"\" {\n\t\t\t\tif stmt.Name != nil {\n\t\t\t\t\taliases[stmt.Name.Name] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\taliases[\"ioutil\"] = stmt.Path.Value\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tcase *ast.CallExpr:\n\t\t\t// Check if any of disallowed functions have been used.\n\t\t\tfor pkg, path := range aliases {\n\t\t\t\tfor _, fn := range disallowedFns {\n\t\t\t\t\tif isPkgDot(stmt.Fun, pkg, fn) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpass.Reportf(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnode.Pos(),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfmt.Sprintf(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"%v: %s.%s() (from %s)\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\terrUnsafePackage,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpkg,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfn,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\n\treturn nil, nil\n}\n\nfunc isPkgDot(expr ast.Expr, pkg, name string) bool {\n\tsel, ok := expr.(*ast.SelectorExpr)\n\tres := ok &amp;&amp; isIdent(sel.X, pkg) &amp;&amp; isIdent(sel.Sel, name)\n\treturn res\n}\n\nfunc isIdent(expr ast.Expr, ident string) bool {\n\tid, ok := expr.(*ast.Ident)\n\treturn ok &amp;&amp; id.Name == ident\n}\n\nTests for our analyzer\nFortunately, the standard library contains a very easy way to test out your analyzer, but it also comes with a few quirks and a specific syntax needed to get it to work. First, let's define a testdata/ directory within our analyzer package. Then, create an analyzer_test.go file:\npackage writefile\n\nimport (\n\t\"testing\"\n\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/analysistest\"\n)\n\nfunc TestAnalyzer(t *testing.T) {\n\tanalysistest.Run(t, analysistest.TestData(), Analyzer)\n}\n\nWe can use the analysistest package to run a bunch of cases within a testdata/ directory for the analyzer, which we'll look into next. At this point, our folder structure looks as follows:\nstatic-analysis/\n\tmain.go\n\twritefile/\n\t\tanalyzer.go\n\t\tanalyzer_test.go\n\t\ttestdata/\n\t\t\timports.go\n\nIn terms of test data, these aren't typical Go test files, but instead follow a specific syntax you can read about here.\n\nAn expectation of a Diagnostic is specified by a string literal containing a regular expression that must match the diagnostic message. For example:\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%s\", 1) // want `cannot provide int 1 to %s`\n\nSo your tests must be comprised of function calls or expressions, followed by a comment next to them expecting what error you want the analyzer to report. In our case, we can write a few examples:\npackage testdata\n\nimport (\n\t\"crypto/rand\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"math/big\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n)\n\nfunc UseOsMkdirAllAndWriteFile() {\n\trandPath, _ := rand.Int(rand.Reader, big.NewInt(1000000))\n\t// Create a random file path in our tmp dir.\n\tp := filepath.Join(os.TempDir(), fmt.Sprintf(\"/%d\", randPath))\n\t_ = os.MkdirAll(p, os.ModePerm) // want \"os and ioutil dir and file writing functions are not permissions-safe, use shared/fileutil\"\n\tsomeFile := filepath.Join(p, \"some.txt\")\n\t_ = ioutil.WriteFile(someFile, []byte(\"hello\"), os.ModePerm) // want \"os and ioutil dir and file writing functions are not permissions-safe, use shared/fileutil\"\n}\n\nNext up, we can run go test to check if our analyzer indeed reports on those functions being used when they shouldn't:\n$ go test ./writefile\nok  \tgithub.com/rauljordan/static-analysis/writefile\t0.845s\n\nApplying the analyzer using Go vet\nTo run our analyzer as a standalone command, the standard library also provides some utility. All we have to do is define the following main.go file\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/rauljordan/static-analysis/writefile\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/singlechecker\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tsinglechecker.Main(writefile.Analyzer)\n}\n\nThen, you can install it into your system $GOBIN with:\ngo install github.com/rauljordan/static-analysis\n\nNext, you can run it as a standalone Go binary passing in a path to a Go package you want to analyze:\nstatic-analysis ./mybadpackage\n\nand see the analyzer in action. You can also integrate it into go vet with go vet -vettool=$(which static-analysis) ./mybadpackage as a custom analyzer. The code for this blog post is available here on Github github.com/rauljordan/static-analysis.\nNext post: advanced static analysis for Go channels\nAlthough parsing the basic AST of a program as well as comparing identifiers to some string are easy operations, the high-level analysis package does not offer much tooling to dive in deeper into actually understanding a program. Let's say we want to prevent our Go code from ever sending over an unbuffered channel where there is no receiver ready. For those unfamiliar, the following Go program will block the main thread of the function we care about, which is not the expected behavior at runtime.\npackage main\n\ntype Email struct {\n\tSubject string\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tch := make(chan *Email)\n\tdefer close(ch)\n\thandleEmailSignup(ch)\n}\n\nfunc handleEmailSignup(ch chan *Email) {\n\t// Some logic regarding handling a signup event.\n\t...\n\n\t// We send over the channel, which we deliberately did not prepare\n\t// a receiver for in another function, thereby blocking the thread.\n\tch &lt;- &amp;Email{\n\t\tSubject: \"New user signup\",\n\t}\n\t// Warning: we'll never hit this line if there is no channel receiver!\n\tlog.Println(\"New user has just signed up!\")\n}\n\nBecause there is no channel receiver set up, we'll never reach the log New user has just signed up, and we will actually block the main thread. This is very dangerous in production applications, where they may not be a channel receiver ready in time before we attempt sending over the channel.\nTo enforce this invariant via static analysis seems daunting, as we not only need to understand where channel operations are called, but also understand whether or not (a) the channel is unbuffered, and (b) we are writing to the same channel pointer in different parts of our program, perhaps in different packages! In a future blog post, we'll look at some advanced tools available in the Go standard library for deeper static analysis.

All computers function around the notion of 1s and 0s, otherwise known as bits, which give us a convenient, common format we can serialize into.\nThe process of serializing data is called Marshaling, and the process of recovering original data from some serialized bytes is known as Unmarshaling. We will be using the two terms extensively throughout this post.\nWhy Serialize at All?\nAlthough all computers speak the same underlying language of 1s and 0s, data gathered from programs running on those computers might have different forms, such as when the username and password a user inputs on a website, or when you type in a Google search. Google needs to be able to take that information from your browser, and translate it into an efficient format its servers can understand to serve your request. Serialized data doesn't have to be in bytes, in fact, it simply needs to be in a format most efficient for the particular system the data will live in - bytes are just the most convenient format for computers to operate in. \nBack in WWII, we used to serialize data into morse code, as that was the most convenient, common format to transmit via voice radio systems between ships!\nSerialization in Current Software Systems\nSerialization is the backbone of data transmission on the Internet. In HTTP, the most common serialization format is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), making it easy to parse user input and is also incredibly supported by the core tools of JavaScript as a language. JSON's benefits come from readability, standardization, and support, although it is not the most compact nor the most efficient way for software systems to transport data. Another alternative is BSON, standing for Binary JSON, which has more efficient serialization rules than JSON and is more flexible for usage as a binary data transmission format.\nFor real world, scalable systems, companies such as Google opt for the much more robust Protocol Buffer specification, another type of serialization language. Protocol Buffers, or protobufs, are used for their powerful schema-like property, which allows projects to specify data structures in a common proto language, which can then be used generate data structures across all types of programming languages which are compliant with the protobuf serialization rules.\nA common use-case for protobufs is for Remote Procedure Calls, known as RPC calls, which are used data exchange between servers. Say that Google has their ads servers running Java code and they want to feed in data into some other server running Python code for some machine learning analysis on users' ad clicks. Google can specify a common protobuf schema:\nmessage AdClick {\n    string url = 1;\n    uint64 user_id = 2;\n}\n\nmessage AdClickResponse {\n    bool ok = 1;\n}\n\nservice AdClickAnalyzer {\n    rpc SendClickData(AdClick) returns (AdClickResponse)\n}\n\nAnd generate the appropriate, compliant data structures in both Python and Java that implement the protobuf serialization format. Having this common language makes data transport simple and unambiguous. Imagine the alternative approach of every project at a company having different rules for how you should communicate with their servers - it would be a nightmare!\nRule #1 Of Serialization: Don't Reinvent the Wheel\nTo say serialization has been overdone is an understatement. Such a core aspect of today's Internet has been widely studied, implemented, and optimized to serve the needs of billions of people around the world - every second, any moment. JSON, protobufs, and other specifications are constantly being micro-optimized and maturing to better serve our highly connected world. Creating a new serialization library from scratch is, in general, a bad idea save for very select situations.\nAny new approach should leverage existing work and understand the limitations and learnings previous approaches have uncovered. Most of these libraries follow a few core tenets:\n3 Tenets of Serialization\n\nSerialization must be unambiguous\nSerialization must be agnostic\nSerialization must be efficient\n\nSerialization Must Be Unambiguous\nImagine you look at a bunch of raw bytes - something like:\n01010100100101000100101010101010\n\nand imagine you have some serialization/deserialization rules that tell you how to decode this information into some readable, useful data. A serialization function would be completely broken if it were not injective. That is, two different object must never map into the same serialization, as this makes the algorithm ambiguous. If the rules tell us the data can decode into the value [3, 4, 5] but it turns out the list can also decode as [5, 4, 3], we have no way of knowing which is the correct one! Serialization is stateless, as we have no access to determining the original value that was serialized into aside from using the inverse of the serialization rules to decode it. Serialization must be unambiguous.\nSerialization Must Be Agnostic\nFrom its earlier definition, serialization is simply a set of rules that allow us to encode and decode data into some common format a system can understand. It should not make assumptions about underlying data and it should not make explicit implementation decisions in its schema. An example of this is making design decisions around specific types that may not be available across different programming languages, preventing others wanting to use the serialization rules in an implementation from doing so due to language constraints. The goal of serialization is simply concerned with translation and definining an unambiguous set of rules for marshaling and unmarshaling data - nothing more, nothing less. Keep it abstract, make no assumptions for what the serialization will be used for, and keep it concise.\nSerialization Must Be Efficient\nThe purpose of serialization is typically for transporting information from one place to another in a common format. Bits are the smallest type possible for computers to compactly represent information, and they translate well to data transmission protocols that exist today via the wires that power the Internet. It is still possible to create a set of serialization rules, however, that add unnecessary bloat to encoded data.\nThe rules for marshaling data should only include what's necessary for a decoder to unambigiously unmarshal the bytes back to their original form - nothing more, nothing less. Think of it like the core axioms of mathematics - they are as concise and abstract as possible such that all of math can be derived from those simple rules we hold as true. We could, for example, say the pythagorean theorem is an axiom of math without needing to prove it. In fact, we could just say all theorems are axioms and are true by default - but that would defeat the purpose of math itself and its ruleset! Having more rules than necessary will simply add bloat to a system, possibly leading to massive inefficiencies when that data needs to be transported between machines.\n\nKeep the core rules simple, don't add more rules than you need to \n\nThe Task: Implement a New Serialization Algorithm in Go\nNow that we've looked at what serialization is and why it matters, let's get into the core of this post. The goal at hand is to create a compliant, Golang implementation of the Simple Serialize specification created by the official Ethereum research team. Ethereum is a global, distributed network of nodes that runs decentralized applications. That is, anyone can use it to write computers that are not ran by any individual, entity, or corporation in a permissionless fashion. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum uses a distributed ledger known as a blockchain to maintain a state of the world and reach consensus.\nThe way nodes across the network communicate is by sending packets of byte encoded data via peer-to-peer (p2p) networking using some standard serialization algorithm. Ethereum is currently in the process of upgrading to its 2.0 version, which will contain radical improvements to its core protocol as well as its network architecture. Serialization for Ethereum 2.0 is being revamped, with the Simple Serialize algorithm, known as SSZ, having won as the de facto standard for marshaling consensus data into bytes.\nEthereum 2.0 has various in-progress implementations in various languages, and my team, Prysmatic Labs, works on a Go implementation called Prysm.\nOur goal is to create a serialization library in Go so we can easily plug into Prysm that is conforms to standard tests handed to us by Ethereum researchers. This is part of a greater interoperability effort so different implementations can communicate between each other unambiguously.\nWhy a New Serialization Format? Why Not Protobuf, JSON, or Others?\nSerialization plays a very important role in distributed systems, particularly blockchain-based protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The entire crux of the network depends on a distributed set of nodes around the world reaching consensus on a set of transactions, marking them as canonical based on a set of voting-majority rules. Imagine if you wanted 1000 different servers around the world agreeing on the following data structure between each other:\ntype State struct {\n    AccountBalancesByUserId map[uint64]uint64\n}\n\nImagine this information is so critical, you can't possibly afford its internal data differing across server implementations. The rules for marshaling and unmarshaling this data must be unambiguous. Serialization schemas such as Protocol Buffers provide support for map data structures as seen above, but map support across languages differ underneat the hood. The problem with using protocol buffers for consensus specifically for map-based types is that they do not provide determinism between languages. That is, a Java protobuf for that data could marshal/unmarshal differently than a Go implementation, and that is unacceptable.\nSerialization for distributed systems operates under an extra constraint that there is zero room for error or non-determinism. For Ethereum, we decided not to use protobufs for serializing important consensus values, as we needed something a lot simpler. This is how simple serialize came to be.\nHow Simple Serialize Works\nEvery serialization specification begins by defining the basic, core types it can support. Basic types then serve as building blocks for more complex types which may have different serialization rules depending on their structure. Once again, a core tenet of serialization is to be unambiguous. That is, we need to the serialized bytes of some initial data give us enough information by themselves along with the serialization ruleset to successfully retrieve the original object if we wanted to. The official Simple Serialize specification as of the time of writing is located here if you want to follow along.\nSimple serialize supports the following basic types:\nuint8 or byte\nuint16\nuint32\nuint64\nbool\n\nWhy Not More Basic Types!?\nNotice the omission of ints and floats from the above, as they are not used for precision reasons in a consensus-critical system such as Ethereum, which demands absolute determinism. Instead, we keep it simple - using only unsigned integers and booleans. \nSSZ as a serialization tool should only be concerned with agnostic marshaling/unmarshaling of data - it should not be concerned with making assumptions about its use cases. \nPostel's Law holds true for SSZ in particular:\n\nBe conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others\nTCP/IP Protocol\n\nThat is, our SSZ implementation should be able to handle all sorts of complex structures and fail gracefully if they are not serializable. At the same time, it should be conservative in its scope, only doing what it needs to do based on its specification without making assumptions about its inner data or use-cases.\nAdditionally, adding other types such as BitLists or BitVectors as primitives to Simple Serialize is like adding more axioms to mathematics, it can make your life easier in the short term but makes your abstractions a lot weaker!\nComposite Types\nFrom these basic types, Simple Serialize defines composite types which are:\n\nContainers: heterogenous collections of values {uint64, bool, uint8, uint16}\nVectors: ordered, fixed size collections of the same type of value [uint64, N]\nLists: ordered, variable length collections of the same type of value [uint64]\n\nTwo other critical rules of Simple Serialize are the definition of element sizes. An element is said to be variable size if, recursively, it contains at least one element which is of variable size. Otherwise, an element is determined to be fixed-size.\nLet's look at some examples:\n\n[[uint64], N] is variable-sized, as despite being a fixed-size vector, its inner element is an unbounded list type\n{field1: [uint64, N], field2: bool} is a fixed-size container as it only contains fixed-size elements\n[{field1: uint64, field2: bool}, N] is fixed-size, as it contains no variable-sized elements\n\nEasy - let's keep going. Now, we define the marshaling rules for each of these basic types, fixed-size types, and variable-size types.\nFor uint types:\nassert N in [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]\nreturn value.to_bytes(N // 8, \"little\")\n\nFor bool types:\nassert value in (True, False)\nreturn b\"\\x01\" if value is True else b\"\\x00\"\n\nFor fixed-size type vectors, we simply serialize them element-wise based on their corresponding elements' marshaling rules.\nbuffer = []\nfor item in value:\n    buffer.append(marshal(item))\n\nFor byte-vectors, we simply leave them as they are as they already represent the format we are using for serialization, namely, a collection of bytes.\nWhen it comes to variable-sized items, however, that's when things get interesting. We have no way of knowing how big a variable-sized element will be unless we have some delimeters that tell us so in their encoded representation. Think of these values kind of like positional markers of when a variable-sized element begins in a collection of bytes. These values are referred to as offsets in the Simple Serialize specification. \nSSZ offsets are denoted by uint32 values which serve as positional markers of where variable-sized items occur in a marshaled set of bytes. Take the container type denoted by:\ntype Example struct {\n    Field1 []byte\n    Field2 []byte\n}\n\nexample := &amp;Example{\n    Field1: []byte{1, 2},\n    Field2: []byte{3},\n}\n\nIts corresponding SSZ encoding will be:\n[8 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 1 2 3]\n\nWhere 8 0 0 0 denotes a uint32 value of 8 which which tells us the first variable sized element begins at index 8 in the list. Similarly, the next offset, 10 0 0 0, tells us there is another variable-sized element which begins at index 10. When we attempt to unmarshal the bytes into a new instance of type &amp;Example, we know exactly where the first field and the next field begin, giving us an unambiguous unmarshaling.\nIn a complex SSZ type, however, variable-sized elements can be interwoven with fixed-size elements, and we similarly use the idea of offsets to denote where the variable ones occur. Let's see an example:\ntype Example2 struct {\n    Field1 []byte\n    Field2 uint16\n    Field3 []byte\n}\n\nexample2 := &amp;Example2{\n    Field1: []byte{1, 2},\n    Field2: 7,\n    Field3: []byte{3},\n}\n\nThis new SSZ encoding, which has a fixed-size uint16 field mixed in, will look like:\n[10 0 0 0 7 0 12 0 0 0 1 2 3]\n\nOnce again telling us that there is a variable-sized element at index 10, one at index 12, and in the middle we have the fixed-size, uint16 field unambiguously. That's pretty much it! Using these basic rules, one may derive even complex, nested types of fixed-size and variable-sized containers and lists.\nThe Limitations of Golang\nGo in particular is an interesting language to build a serialization library in due to its lack of generics - a very common trait of other languages. The lack of generics makes it really difficult to write functions that work on general types in Go, and instead Go has to rely on tricky approaches such as inspecting the metadata of values, which can lead to massive inefficiencies. One of the only safe options Go has for writing generic libraries is the \"reflect\" package, which gives us a whole suite of utilities for doing metaprogramming - the notion of a computer program inferring details about its own structure.\nThe problem with using reflect in Go comes down to its speed. Go was not built in its current form to support generics underneath the hood, making it expensive to infer and operate on abstract types. The closest thing Go has to a generic type is the interface{} type, which is not exactly like the generic types in other languages. In Python, for example, which is a dynamically-typed language, the following code is perfectly valid:\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\nIn Go, however, you can't just add two interfaces unless you coerce them into a concrete type that allows for addition, such as uint64. The following piece of Go code is invalid:\nfunc add(v1 interface{}, v2 interface{}) interface{} {\n    return v1 + v2\n}\n\nGiving us the error invalid operation: v1 + v2 (operator + not defined on interface), as expected. If we really want to be able to create a generic add function as above, we'll have to infer the concrete types of the function arguments using the reflect package and act accordingly. Let's use a switch statement to do so:\nimport (\n    \"errors\"\n    \"reflect\"\n)\n\nfunc add(v1 interface{}, v2 interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n    rval1 := reflect.ValueOf(v1)\n    rval2 := reflect.ValueOf(v2)\n    k1 := rval1.Type().Kind()\n    k2 := rval2.Type().Kind()\n    switch {\n    case k1 == reflect.Uint64 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Uint64:\n        return rval1.Interface().(uint64) + rval2.Interface().(uint64), nil\n    case k1 == reflect.Uint32 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Uint32:\n        return rval1.Interface().(uint32) + rval2.Interface().(uint32), nil\n    case k1 == reflect.Uint16 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Uint16:\n        return rval1.Interface().(uint16) + rval2.Interface().(uint16), nil\n    case k1 == reflect.Uint8 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Uint8:\n        return rval1.Interface().(uint8) + rval2.Interface().(uint8), nil\n    case k1 == reflect.Int64 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Int64:\n        return rval1.Interface().(int64) + rval2.Interface().(int64), nil\n    case k1 == reflect.Int32 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Int32:\n        return rval1.Interface().(int32) + rval2.Interface().(int32), nil\n    case k1 == reflect.Int16 &amp;&amp; k2 == reflect.Int16:\n        return rval1.Interface().(int16) + rval2.Interface().(int16), nil\n    default:\n        return nil, errors.New(\"expected numeric values\")\n    }\n}\n\nOuch - look at how painful that was! Even worse, let's see how slow it is against a function that just concretely takes in uint64 values as arguments.\nBenchmarkAddGeneric-4                   20000000                85.1 ns/op            24 B/op          3 allocs/op\nBenchmarkAddUint64-4                    2000000000               0.34 ns/op            0 B/op          0 allocs/op\n\nUsing reflect makes a big difference - imagine if we have to do the same thing but for more complex types such as nested structs! Let's see how we can tackle actually implementing SSZ in Go.\nHigh Level Approach\nAlright, so we do not have access to generics for our Simple Serialize implementation, and our approach must be generic enough to handle extremely complex data structures efficiently and correctly. Moreover, we need to be able to round trip, benchmark, and ensure correctness of our code as we go along. Where do we start? Let's first go back to the basics of how we made a generic add function in Go. It is not truly generic, as it actually does type assertions on a few, selected numeric types and applies their addition operations. Along the same vein, our SSZ implementation should only concern itself with supporting the types enumerated in its official specification. \nThe most naive approach would be to have a giant, recursive function that uses a huge switch statement to figure out how to handle every different type. Our approach will instead focus on creating specific marshaler and unmarshaler functions for the various types which satisfy a common Go interface.\nIn general, we need a few things in our marshaler and unmarshaler functions.\n\nFor Marshaling, we want to track the latest positional index we have written into some bytes buffer\nFor Unmarshaling, we want to track the latest positional index we have read from some bytes buffer\nInside both functions, we want to either write (Marshal) or read (Unmarshal) N bytes from a bytes buffer and return the positional index the next Marshaler/Unmarshaler should start from, i.e. the current index + N\n\nWith that in mind, we can define the following two key interfaces that are enough for us to handle the entire SSZ spec in an abstract fashion:\ntype Marshaler interface {\n    func MarshalType(val reflect.Value, b []byte, lastWrittenIdx uint64) (nextIdx uint64, error)\n}\n\ntype Unmarshaler interface {\n    func UnmarshalType(target reflect.Value, b []byte, lastReadIdx uint64) (nextIdx uint64, error)\n}\n\nThe Marshaler type specifies a function, MarshalType, which can take in an abstract value, a buffer we will write into, and the last index into the buffer we have written into. \n\nThis last index is a positional marker that tells us where we are in the process of \nwriting the serialized encoding of the input value\n\nSimilarly, the Unmarshaler type specifies a function, UnmarshalType, which can take a buffer of SSZ-marshaled bytes, a target value we will deserialize into, and the last index we have read from the buffer. This last index is a positional marker that tells us where we are in the process of reading marshaled bytes from the serialized encoding.\nMarshaling\nThe first thing we should do when Marshaling is to go back to our trusty switch statement to determine the type we're looking at before we decide how it should be handled. \nfunc Marshal(data interface{}) ([]byte, error) {\n    val := reflect.ValueOf(data)\n    m, err := makeMarshaler(val)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    totalBufferSize := determineSize(val)\n    buffer := make([]byte, totalBufferSize)\n    if _, err = m.MarshalType(rval, buf, 0 /* start index */); err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to marshal for type: %v\", rval.Type())\n    }\n    return buffer, nil\n}\n\nfunc makeMarshaler(val reflect.Value) (Marshaler, error) {\n    kind := val.Type().Kind()\n    switch {\n    case kind == reflect.Bool:\n        // Handle bool marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Uint8:\n        // Handle uint marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Uint16:\n        // Handle uint marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Uint32:\n        // Handle uint marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Uint64:\n        // Handle uint marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Slice &amp;&amp; typ.Elem().Kind() == reflect.Uint8:\n        // Handle byte slice marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Array &amp;&amp; typ.Elem().Kind() == reflect.Uint8:\n        // Handle byte array marshaling...\n    case isBasicTypeSlice(val.Type()) || isBasicTypeArray(val.Type()):\n        // Handle basic-type array/slice marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Array &amp;&amp; !isVariableSizeType(typ.Elem()):\n        // Handle fixed-size element array marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Slice &amp;&amp; !isVariableSizeType(typ.Elem()):\n        // Handle fixed-size element slice marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Slice || kind == reflect.Array:\n        // Handle variable-sized element slice/array marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Struct:\n        // Handle struct marshaling...\n    case kind == reflect.Ptr:\n        // Handle pointer marshaling...\n    default:\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"type %v is not serializable\", typ)\n    }\n}\n\n// determineSize figures out the total size of the SSZ-encoding in order\n// to preallocate a buffer before marshaling.\nfunc determineSize(val reflect.Value) uint64 {\n    ...\n}\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, we can return an abstract Marshaler interface for the different types we support for SSZ. Notice at the top, we have to also determine the total size of the serialized bytes before we begin writing to a buffer, otherwise we'll be getting nasty index out of range issues in Go. That is, if we want to encode the number uint64(5), we need 8 bytes to do so, so we would need to preallocate some fixed-size buffer before we begin marshaling at all.\nThe above gives us as generic and as flexible of a basic marshaling approach for SSZ. To proceed, we'd just need to fill in the blanks and create marshalers that work for the different types based on the SSZ specification. Here's what the MarshalType function for some of these basic types would look like:\nimport \"binary\"\n\ntype BoolSSZ bool\ntype Uint64SSZ uint64\n\n// Boolean basic type marshaling.\nfunc (b BoolSSZ) MarshalType(val reflect.Value, b []byte, lastWrittenIdx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    if val.Bool() {\n        buf[lastWrittenIdx] = uint8(1)\n    } else {\n        buf[lastWrittenIdx] = uint8(0)\n    }\n    return lastWrittenIdx + 1, nil\n}\n\n// Uint64 basic type marshaling.\nfunc (b Uint64SSZ) MarshalType(val reflect.Value, b []byte, lastWrittenIdx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    v := val.Uint()\n    encoded := make([]byte, 8)\n    binary.LittleEndian.PutUint64(encoded, uint64(v))\n    copy(buf[lastWrittenIdx:lastWrittenIdx+8], encoded)\n    return lastWrittenIndex + 8, nil\n}\n\nAs long as we satisfy the Marshaler interface, we can rinse and repeat for all basic types! Go is indeed powerful, but let's take a look at the most complicated marshaling example.\nvar BytesPerLengthOffset = 4\n\ntype SliceMarshaler struct {\n    elementMarshaler Marshaler\n}\n\nfunc NewSliceMarshaler(val reflect.Value) (*SliceMarshaler, error) {\n    // We attach the marshaler for the slice's particular element type\n    // to the struct for usage later.\n    elementMarshaler, err := makeMarshaler(val.Elem())\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    return &amp;SliceMarshaler{elementMarshaler}\n}\n\nfunc (s *SliceMarshaler) MarshalType(val reflect.Value, b []byte, lastWrittenIdx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    currentIndex := lastWrittenIndex\n    typ := val.Type()\n    var err error\n    if isVariableSizeType(typ) {\n        currentIndex, err = s.marshalVariableSize(val, b, currentIndex)\n        if err != nil {\n            return 0, err\n        }\n    } else {\n        currentIndex, err = s.marshalFixedSize(val, b, currentIndex)\n        if err != nil {\n            return 0, err\n        }\n    }\n    return index, nil\n}\n\n// If an element is variable sized, we need to also keep track of its \n// offset indices and where they tell us to begin checking for its \n// next variable-sized element in the input. Using these two positional\n// trackers, we can write the offsets at their respective positions\n// as well as write the actual values we are marshaling into the buffer\n// at the current index we are tracking.\nfunc (s *SliceMarshaler) marshalVariableSize(val reflect.Val, b []byte, idx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    currentIndex := idx\n    fixedElementIndex := currentIndex\n    startOffset := lastWrittenIndex\n    currentOffsetIndex := startOffset + val.Len()*BytesPerLengthOffset\n    nextOffsetIndex := currentOffsetIndex\n    // If the elements are variable size, we need to include offset indices\n    // in the serialized output list.\n    for i := 0; i &lt; val.Len(); i++ {\n        nextOffsetIndex, err = s.elementMarshaler.MarshalType(val.Index(i), b, currentOffsetIndex)\n        if err != nil {\n            return 0, err\n        }\n        // Write the variable-sized element offset.\n        offsetBuf := make([]byte, BytesPerLengthOffset)\n        binary.LittleEndian.PutUint32(offsetBuf, uint32(currentOffsetIndex-startOffset))\n        copy(b[fixedElementIndex:fixedElementIndex+BytesPerLengthOffset], offsetBuf)\n\n        // We increase the positional index tracker of the offsets accordingly.\n        currentOffsetIndex = nextOffsetIndex\n        fixedElementIndex += BytesPerLengthOffset\n    }\n    return currentOffsetIndex\n}\n\n// If each element is not variable size, we simply encode sequentially and write\n// into the buffer at the last index we wrote at.\nfunc (s *SliceMarshaler) marshalFixedSize(val reflect.Val, b []byte, idx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    currentIndex := idx\n    var err error\n    for i := 0; i &lt; val.Len(); i++ {\n        currentIndex, err = s.elementMarshaler.MarshalType(val.Index(i), b, currentIndex)\n        if err != nil {\n            return 0, err\n        }\n    }\n    return currentIndex, nil\n}\n\nAlthough it looks a bit intimidating, let's break it down into pieces. First, we create an instance of a slice marshaler that also contains a field which gives us access to a marshaler for that slice's individual elements. Then, we check if the slice has fixed-sized elements, for which we simply loop through the slice's length and call the element marshaler at each index of the slice.\nOtherwise, we perform a more complex, variable-sized element marshaling. As mentioned in how SSZ works, we need to keep track of particular offset values which tell us the positional indices where variable sized elements begin in the serialization. We also need to keep track of the current writing position into the buffer accordingly. We loop through the slice's length, determine any offsets, write those offsets to the buffer, and update the positional trackers respectively. Voilà, that's pretty much the hardest part of writing an SSZ marshaler :). For container types, such as structs, we have to keep track of the marshalers for each of their fields, and simply loop over the struct's fields and perform the same logic as above.\nUnmarshaling\nNow for the hard part...unmarshaling. This part of SSZ is particularly tricky because there are no hard-and fast rules for doing so aside from \"doing the inverse of serialization\". That is, we'll find ourselves in some hairy situations due to variable-size offsets that will massively increase the complexity of the implementation. Additionally, we'll hit some important gotchas of using Go's reflect package along the way.\nUnmarshaling follows the similar philosophy of creating different types that comply with the Unmarshaler interface and pattern matching types through a switch statement at the start. Compared to marshaling, however, we do not need to create a bytes buffer of a certain size beforehand, but we have to do something even more difficult. We have to deeply hydrate the value we are unmarshaling into, and that's where the Go gotchas come into play.\nWe start with our top-level Unmarshal function:\nfunc Unmarshal(input []byte, val interface{}) error {\n    rval := reflect.ValueOf(val)\n    if rval.IsNil() {\n        return errors.New(\"cannot unmarshal into untyped, nil value\")\n    }\n    rtyp := rval.Type()\n    // val must be a pointer, otherwise we refuse to unmarshal.\n    if rtyp.Kind() != reflect.Ptr {\n        return errors.New(\"can only unmarshal into a pointer target\")\n    }\n    m, err := makeUnmarshaler(val)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    if _, err = m.UnmarshalType(rval.Elem(), input, 0 /* last read idx */); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"could not unmarshal input into type: %v, %v\", rval.Elem().Type(), err)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nLet's take a look at some basic type unmarshaling:\nimport \"binary\"\n\ntype Uint32SSZ uint64\n\nfunc (u Uint32SSZ) UnmarshalBytes(val reflect.Value, b []byte lastReadIdx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    nextReadIdx := lastReadIdx + 4\n    buf := make([]byte, 4)\n    copy(buf, b[lastReadIdx:nextReadIdxjj])\n    val.SetUint(uint64(binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(buf)))\n    return nextReadIdx, nil\n}\n\nSo what's the hard part? Let's check out how we would unmarshal the following:\ntype FixedSizeItem struct {\n    Field1 uint32\n}\n\ndata := [3]*FixedSizeItem{\n    &amp;FixedSizeItem{ Field1: 7 },\n    &amp;FixedSizeItem{ Field1: 8 },\n    &amp;FixedSizeItem{ Field1: 9 },\n}\n\nencoded, err := ssz.Marshal(data)\nif err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n}\n\nvar decoded [3]*FixedSizeItem\nif err := ssz.Unmarshal(encoded, &amp;decoded); err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n}\n\nGiven it's a simple array of fixed size elements, we could simply unmarshal element-wise as follows:\ncurrentIndex := lastReadIdx\nfor i := 0; i &lt; val.Len(); i++ {\n    // if val.Index(i).Kind() == reflect.Ptr {\n    //     instantiateConcreteTypeForElement(val.Index(i), typ.Elem().Elem())\n    // }\n    currentIndex, err = m.UnmarshalType(val.Index(i), b, currentIndex)\n    if err != nil {\n        return 0, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to unmarshal element of array: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\nreturn currentIndex, nil\n\nBut if we run this, we get the the following error!\npanic: cannot call Type() of nil value\n\nWhat gives? When we initialize a variable which will be the target of the unmarshaling, it knows it has to be of type [3]*FixedSizeItem, however, we haven't deeply initialized the values of that array with the correct zero values we will unmarshal into. That is, once we're attempting to unmarshal each &amp;FixedSizeItem type contained in this array, that item has not been initialized, so what we are feeding the unmarshaler is an array of nil values\n[nil, nil, nil]\n\nEven though the array above has the correct type, we are not able to deduce the unmarshaler properly for each individual element, as they are all initialized to nil! Instead, we have to deeply hydrate the type if it is nil.\nfunc instantiateConcreteTypeForElement(val reflect.Value, typ reflect.Type) {\n    val.Set(reflect.New(typ))\n}\n\n...\n\ncurrentIndex := lastReadIdx\nfor i := 0; i &lt; val.Len(); i++ {\n    if val.Index(i).Kind() == reflect.Ptr {\n        instantiateConcreteTypeForElement(val.Index(i), typ.Elem().Elem())\n    }\n    currentIndex, err = m.UnmarshalType(val.Index(i), b, currentIndex)\n    if err != nil {\n        return 0, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to unmarshal element of array: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\nreturn currentIndex, nil\n\nThis makes our unmarshaling logic at a tad bit obscure, but it gets even worse once we have to deal with slices, as slices have no fixed-size as part of their type definition, making it impossible to iterate over them and unmarshal pointwise like we can do with fixed-size arrays. Instead, on each iteration, we have to:\n\nGrow the slice's length by 1\nDeeply hydrate the element at the current index in the slice\n\nfunc growConcreteSliceValue(val reflect.Value, typ reflect.Type, length int) {\n    newVal := reflect.MakeSlice(typ, length, length)\n    reflect.Copy(newVal, val)\n    val.Set(newVal)\n    if val.Index(length-1).Kind() == reflect.Ptr {\n        instantiateConcreteTypeForElement(val.Index(length-1), typ.Elem().Elem())\n    }\n}\n\nWe can accomplish this using the helper above, but all we're doing once again is instantiating the correct zero-values of a type so we can successfully unmarshal without panics.\nLet's put this together and see how we can handle variable-sized slices:\nvar BytesPerLengthOffset = 4\n\ntype SliceUnmarshaler struct {\n    elementUnmarshaler Unmarshaler\n}\n\nfunc NewSliceUnmarshaler(val reflect.Value) (*SliceUnmarshaler, error) {\n    // We attach the marshaler for the slice's particular element type\n    // to the struct for usage later.\n    typ := val.Type()\n    elementUnmarshaler, err := makeUnmarshaler(typ.Elem())\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    return &amp;SliceUnmarshaler{elementUnmarshaler}\n}\n\nfunc (s *SliceUnmarshaler) UnmarshalType(val reflect.Value, b []byte, lastReadIdx uint64) (uint64, error) {\n    if len(input) == 0 {\n        newVal := reflect.MakeSlice(val.Type(), 0, 0)\n        val.Set(newVal)\n        return 0, nil\n    }\n    growConcreteSliceType(val, typ, 1)\n    endOffset := uint64(len(input))\n    currentIndex := lastReadIdx\n    nextIndex := currentIndex\n    offsetVal := input[startOffset : startOffset+BytesPerLengthOffset]\n    firstOffset := startOffset + uint64(binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(offsetVal))\n    currentOffset := firstOffset\n    nextOffset := currentOffset\n    i := 0\n    for currentIndex &lt; firstOffset {\n        nextIndex = currentIndex + BytesPerLengthOffset\n        // We have to keep track of the position of each offset we use for reading.\n        if nextIndex == firstOffset {\n            nextOffset = endOffset\n        } else {\n            // We then determine the next offset by reading 4 bytes (BytesPerLengthOffset).\n            nextOffsetVal := input[nextIndex : nextIndex+BytesPerLengthOffset]\n            nextOffset = startOffset + uint64(binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(nextOffsetVal))\n        }\n        // We grow the slice's size to accommodate a new element being unmarshaled.\n        growConcreteSliceType(val, typ, i+1)\n        if _, err := s.elementUnmarshaler.UnmarshalType(val.Index(i), input[currentOffset:nextOffset], 0 /* last read element idx */); err != nil {\n            return 0, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to unmarshal element of slice: %v\", err)\n        }\n        i++\n        currentIndex = nextIndex\n        currentOffset = nextOffset\n    }\n    return currentIndex, nil\n\nWe have to add a special caveat that if we are unmarshaling a nil value, we simply create a slice of size 0 and return, otherwise we will encounter painful panics down the line! Phew, using Go and its lack of generics adds massive complexity when it comes to populating a raw pointer of a certain type, but that covers the basics.\nLimitations of Go-SSZ\nUnfortunately, there are still some inherent limitations in the rules of SSZ that prevent us from unambiguously unmarshal certain types of data. In particular, consider we run into a value that our unmarshaler determines is empty and is of slice type. We have no way to know if it should unmarshal as nil or as []\n\nSSZ unmarshaling is ambiguous when it comes to empty values in Go\n\nSay if you want to round-trip test the following:\nimport (\n    \"reflect\"\n    \"testing\"\n    \"github.com/prysmaticlabs/go-ssz\"\n)\n\ntype AmbiguousItem struct {\n    Field1 []byte\n    Field2: uint64\n}\n\nfunc TestRoundTrip(t *testing.T) {\n    item := &amp;AmbiguousItem{\n        Field2: 5,\n    }\n\n    encoded, err := ssz.Marshal(item)\n    if err != nil {\n        t.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    var decoded *AmbiguousItem\n    if err := ssz.Unmarshal(encoded, decoded); err != nil {\n        t.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    if !reflect.DeepEqual(item, decoded) {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected %v, received %v\", item, decodedjj)\n    }\n}\n\nYou'll see the following error message pop-up:\nExpected { Field1: nil, Field2: 5 }, received { Field1: []. Field2: 5}\n\nOur unmarshal prefers to unmarshal into an empty slice despite the original being nil, how can we resolve this? Typically, serialization libraries in Go run into similar roadblocks, and they suggest checking equality of objects within their scope by using their own custom comparison function. For this purpose, we had to write our own ssz.DeepEqual to catch these little nuances of SSZ which reflect.DeepEqual would not be able to discern.\nNo serialization specification is perfect in every language, but we can afford to make these compromises in Go for a better developer experience and to reduce ambiguity.\nTesting\nWriting tests for a generic serialization is tricky, as they must be exhaustive, however, there are infinite types you can try your marshaling/unmarshaling rules on. How can we measure robustness? \nThe standard approach for establishing robustness in Go is to include the following:\n\nEdge case unit tests\nComprehensive fuzz tests\n\nAt a high level, the API for SSZ is quite simple and easy to understand. There are only 2 core functions needed for SSZ, which are Marshal and Unmarshal:\nfunc Marshal(val interface{}) ([]byte, error)\n\nfunc Unmarshal(encoded []byte, val interface{}) error\n\nTheir conciseness is no accident, as we designed this API to match the very popular JSON marshaler/unmarshaler from the Go standard library. Aside from hiding implementation details, the reason this was done was for powerful access to testing primitives in the form of serialization fuzz testing.\nFrom Techopedia:\n\nFuzz testing is a means of stress test applications by feeding random data into them in order to spot any errors or hang-ups that may occur. The idea behind fuzz testing is that software applications and systems can have a lot of different bugs or glitches related to data input.\n\nHaving fuzz tests can help us feed our round trip tests through all sorts of randomized data structures to ensure we catch those pesky panics and improve the robustness of our SSZ toolset.\nFor basic edge case, sanity-focused unit tests, we can opt for simple table-driven tests in Go to get the job done. We'll be doing a simple, round-trip marshal/unmarshal test to ensure we can recover data in its original form after passing through SSZ.\ntype item struct {\n    Field1 []byte\n}\n\ntype nestedItem struct {\n    Field1 []uint64\n    Field2 *item\n    Field3 [3]byte\n}\n\nvar nestedItemExample = nestedItem{\n    Field1: []uint64{2, 3, 4},\n    Field2: &amp;item{\n        Field1: []byte{0},\n    },\n    Field3: [3]byte{1, 1, 1},\n}\n\nfunc TestMarshalUnmarshal(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct {\n        input interface{}\n        ptr   interface{}\n    }{\n        // Bool test cases.\n        {input: true, ptr: new(bool)},\n        {input: false, ptr: new(bool)},\n        // Uint test cases.\n        {input: byte(1), ptr: new(byte)},\n        {input: uint16(232), ptr: new(uint16)},\n        {input: uint32(1029391), ptr: new(uint32)},\n        {input: uint64(23929309), ptr: new(uint64)},\n        // Byte slice, byte array test cases.\n        {input: [8]byte{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, ptr: new([8]byte)},\n        {input: []byte{9, 8, 9, 8}, ptr: new([]byte)},\n        // Basic type array test cases.\n        {input: [12]uint64{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, ptr: new([12]uint64)},\n        {input: [100]bool{true, false, true, true}, ptr: new([100]bool)},\n        // Basic type slice test cases.\n        {input: []bool{true, false, true, true, true}, ptr: new([]bool)},\n        {input: []uint32{0, 0, 0}, ptr: new([]uint32)},\n        // Struct decoding test cases.\n        {input: nestedItemExample, ptr: new(nestedItem)},\n        // Non-basic type slice/array test cases.\n        {input: [2]nestedItem{nestedItemExample}, ptr: new([2]nestedItem)},\n        // Pointer-type test cases.\n        {input: &amp;nestedItemExample, ptr: new(nestedItem)},\n    }\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        serializedItem, err := ssz.Marshal(tt.input)\n        if err != nil {\n            t.Fatal(err)\n        }\n        if err := ssz.Unmarshal(serializedItem, tt.ptr); err != nil {\n            t.Fatal(err)\n        }\n        output := reflect.ValueOf(tt.ptr)\n        inputVal := reflect.ValueOf(tt.input)\n        if inputVal.Kind() == reflect.Ptr {\n            if !ssz.DeepEqual(output.Interface(), tt.input) {\n                t.Errorf(\"Expected %v, received %v\", tt.input, output.Interface())\n            }\n        } else {\n            got := output.Elem().Interface()\n            want := tt.input\n            if !ssz.DeepEqual(want, got) {\n                t.Errorf(\"Did not unmarshal properly: wanted %v, received %v\", tt.input, output.Elem().Interface())\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBenchmarks and Standards\nThe final step for wrapping up our serialization library has to do with benchmarking and standardization. Note our focus of this implementation was a correct/robust first approach without much attention to optimization. Using benchmarks and Go's pprof are the best ways to catch any relevant bottlenecks, but the most likely problem we will encounter is a massive amount of allocations per operation, as we are consistently creating new pointers, new reflect values, and more. \nAlec Thomas has put together an excellent repository standardizing serialization benchmarks in Go across different libraries you can find here. We will be adding Go-SSZ to that list quite soon! In the meantime, expect a follow-up post on optimizing SSZ!\nCheck out our full repo here: github.com/prysmaticlabs/go-ssz\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/go-lessons-from-writing-a-serialization-library-for-ethereum/","title":"Go Lessons from Writing a Serialization Library for Ethereum"},"https://rauljordan.com/how-i-accurately-predicted-loan-payments-on-the-lendingclub-dataset/":{"body":"I had a blast at a hackathon where all sorts of beginners and experts got together for a 6 hour sprint to solve a Machine Learning problem. Personally, I had no idea what we would be doing...would we be coming up with our own data sets? Participating in a Kaggle competition on the spot?\nThe Challenge\nInstead of that, Aleksandar, the organizer of the event, gave us a challenge: to accurately predict whether or not a loan would get repaid using lendingclub.com’s public datasets. For those unfamiliar, LendingClub is a company that allows anyone with some extra cash to finance other people’s loans and put that money to work. After someone submits a loan request for whatever reason (weddings, small businesses, buying a car), LendingClub’s platform determines the level of risk the loan would have based on dozens of factors that describe the trustworthiness of the user at hand.\nLendingClub collects all sorts of info from its users ranging from their FICO score, their credit utilization rate, the purpose of the loan request, and much more, amounting to a single, important result: whether or not that user fully repays his or her loans.\nA Machine Learning program is when a computer is able to improve performance at a task through experience, and this was an excellent example for anyone looking to get their feet wet.\nOur task was to predict whether or not a new user will repay a loan, our experience is the wealth of data that LendingClub gives us about tens of thousands of users, and our performance is how accurately we can predict this piece of information. To evaluate our models, we chose to follow Matthews’ Correlation Coefficient\n\nThis evaluation metric gave us a really solid way of taking into account the number of false positive, false negative, true positive, and true negative predictions our model is able to output. It is always more important to choose a metric that better quantifies the uncertainty and characteristics of our data rather than choosing one that is easy to optimize for the purpose of looking like you did a good job.\nThe end goal of using Machine Learning is being able to derive insights from data to make business decisions, and if we aren’t able to explain to the people in charge how we got to those insights the process is completely useless!\nGreat! So we got our challenge, our data, our goals, now we split the room up into groups of 6 and started downloading the data sets from LendingClub’s website. Should be pretty simple, right? The data’s probably gonna be all cleaned up in pretty columns and names that we can easily understand\n...right?\nWrong.\n\nThe life of a Data Scientist is often filled with the menial work of data preprocessing. In the real world, we will always have to fix up the way our data is formatted and clean things up so we can plug it into our fancy algorithms, and this was no exception. In the LendingClub data, we had percentages formatted and represented as string, consistently empty fields, weird categorization practices that differed by column, and all sorts of other horrible, evil things.\nStep 1: Data Preprocessing and Cleanup\nWe spun up a Jupyter notebook to start our process with 6 hours to go and got right into it. You can never get quite enough practice with data cleanup, so it’s great to approach this always with a positive mindset :).\nFirst of all, we imported all the necessary packages and loaded LendingClub’s data from 2012 through 2013 as a csv\n{% highlight python %}\n%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ndf_2012_2013 = pd.read_csv('./data/2012-2013.csv', skiprows=1)\n{% endhighlight %}\nSince we do want to treat this a binary classification problem, we have to create our targets column using the loan_status field in our dataset. LendingClub formats a loan as being “Fully Paid”, “In Repayment”, “Defaulted”, and a few other string types. Let’s encode Fully Paid as 1 and anything else as a 0.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_target = df_2012_2013['loan_status'] == 'Fully Paid'\ndf_target = df_target.astype(int)\ndf_2012_2013['target'] = df_target\n{% endhighlight %}\nWe also have a ton of different columns that have all empty values and we can easily drop those as well as the ID column in our data.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_2012_2013 = df_2012_2013.dropna(axis=1, how='all')\ndf_2012_2013 = df_2012_2013.drop('id',axis=1)\n{% endhighlight %}\nGreat so things start to look a little bit cleaner. So now, a good way to approach this data preprocessing problem is to think about it in two chunks: the entire subset of categorical features (loan purpose, issue date, loan grade) and the other subset of purely numerical features (loan amount, total payment made, etc.). We started by going through the categorical features first.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_categorical = df_2012_2013.select_dtypes(include=['object'])\nprint df_categorical.columns\n{% endhighlight %}\nTo begin, we looked at the columns that had more than one unique category. For example, the loan_purpose feature has a bunch\n{% highlight python %}\nprint df_categorical['purpose'].unique()\nOutput Below\narray(['Fully Paid', 'Charged Off', nan, 'Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Fully Paid', 'Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Charged Off'], dtype=object)\n{% endhighlight %}\nThen we ended up dropping the ones that did not have more than a single unique category to clean things up. We also saw that some features represented percentages as strings and we did not want that, so we did a simple transformation to turn those columns into numerical columns.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_categorical.int_rate = df_categorical.int_rate.str.rstrip('%').astype(float) / 100.0\n{% endhighlight %}\nNow, for certain features such as the employment length of an individual, we had a fixed number of categories (1+ year, 10+ years, 6 months) that we could then one-hot encode into our model, so here’s how we did that.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_categorical['emp_length'] = df_categorical['emp_length'].fillna('n/a')\nemp_length = pd.get_dummies(df_categorical['emp_length'])\ndf_categorical = df_categorical.join(emp_length)\ndf_categorical = df_categorical.drop('emp_length', axis=1)\n{% endhighlight %}\nSo why can't we simply turn these into numbers from 1 to whatever the number of categories are? Well, the problem is that many of our algorithms place a lot of weight on the size of our values, so then a 4 will have more value than a 2 when in reality they represent distinct objects of equal weight. This is why we typically one-hot encode categorical variables in our data. Take a look at the notebook to see exactly how we preprocessed every single categorical column in depth.\nNow for the numerical values, we split our data into a different subset. The first thing we did was to examine all the columns that have values with a standard deviation of 0, meaning that there is nothing that column adds to our model. There is no variation in values and it would be basically useless in practice.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_numerical = df_2012_2013.select_dtypes(include=['int', 'float64'])\ndf_numerical.std() == 0.0\ndf_numerical = df_numerical.drop(['out_prncp', 'out_prncp_inv', 'collections_12_mths_ex_med', 'policy_code', 'chargeoff_within_12_mths'], axis=1)\n{% endhighlight %}\nNow, we had certain columns that have many NaN values that we can’t simply drop or replace with a 0. For example, in the Months Since Last Delinquency column and the Months Since Last Record columnn, it makes sense to fill NaN values with the maximum value of the column. For others, it’s sufficient to set NaN’s to 0.\n{% highlight python %}\ndf_numerical['mths_since_last_delinq'] = df_numerical['mths_since_last_delinq'].fillna(120.0)\ndf_numerical['mths_since_last_record'] = df_numerical['mths_since_last_record'].fillna(129.0)\ndf_numerical['delinq_2yrs'] = df_numerical['delinq_2yrs'].fillna(0.0)\ndf_numerical = df_numerical.drop('tax_liens', axis=1)\ndf_numerical['funded_amnt'] = df_numerical['funded_amnt'].fillna(0.0)\ndf_numerical['loan_amnt'] = df_numerical['loan_amnt'].fillna(0.0)\ndf_numerical = df_numerical.fillna(0.0)\ndf_train = df_numerical.join(df_categorical)\ndf_train = df_train.dropna(axis=0)\n{% endhighlight %}\nWHEW!! Now we have our finished, preprocessed training set :). Let’s do some cool stuff with it.\n{% highlight python %}\ncorr = df_numerical.corr()\nplt.figure(figsize=(16,16))\nsns.heatmap(corr, xticklabels=corr.columns, yticklabels=corr.columns)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nThe correlation matrix makes sense. We have a lot of features that are obviously very related such as the total payment of the loan, along with the total received late fees and installment. We can do any other exploratory data analysis using this completely preprocessed training set.\nStep 3: Model Selection &amp; Hyperparameter Optimization\nNow here’s when the Machine Learning kicks in…took long enough, but hang in there, it’ll be worth it.\nFirst of all, we’ll need to split up our data into training and testing using Scikit Learn’s built in train_test_split.\n{% highlight python %}\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\nx_train, x_test = train_test_split(df_train)\ntrain_target = x_train['target']\nx_train = x_train.drop('target', axis=1)\ntest_target = x_test['target']\nx_test = x_test.drop('target', axis=1)\n{% endhighlight %}\nThen, we’ll plug this into a Random Forest Classifier, a pretty solid algorithm for this type of structured data.\n{% highlight python %}\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nparameters = { 'max_depth': [1, 2, 3] }\nrf = RandomForestClassifier()\nclf = GridSearchCV(rf, parameters)\nclf.fit(x_train, train_target)\n{% endhighlight %}\nNow let’s predict some loans the model hasn’t seen before:\n{% highlight python %}\ny_pred = clf.predict(x_test)\n{% endhighlight %}\n{% highlight python %}\nfrom sklearn.metrics import matthews_corrcoef, roc_auc_score\nprint \"Result Matthews: \" + matthews_corrcoef(test_target, y_pred)\nprint \"Result AUC: \" + roc_auc_score(test_target, y_pred)\nOutput\nResult Matthews: 0.8944664813948131\nResult AUC: 0.91678387248007498\n{% endhighlight %}\nAwesome! The very first attempt and we get an AUC score of 91%! Solid feature engineering and being nitpicky about how to deal with sparse data can go a very long way with how models perform!

GraphQL completely changed that landscape!\nWith GraphQL, developers are able to write a simple query string for an endpoint that reads kinda like simplified JSON according to a functions called resolvers that interact with a database and contain the business logic that actually fetches the data.\nFor example, if you have a GraphQL endpoint that returns the currently signed in user, you can fetch it as follows:\nconst query = gql`\n  query MyExampleQuery {\n    currentUser {\n      name\n      photo\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nThen, we can plug it into a react component and render that data however we want.\nimport { graphql, compose } from 'react-apollo';\n\nfunction UserProfile(props) {\n  return 'Your Name is: {props.data.currentUser.name}';\n}\n\nexport default compose(graphql(query))(UserProfile);\n\nA cool thing about GraphQL is that it allows you to define how all of your models interact with each other and how they are connected. It basically gives you the ability to create an API Graph for your application. For example, the return type of the currentUser query is the User type, and the return type of the friends query is also a User type, allowing us to do fancy things like:\nconst query = gql`\n  query MyExampleQuery {\n    currentUser {\n      name\n      photo\n      friends(limit: 10) {\n        name\n        photo\n        friends(limit: 10) {\n          name\n          photo\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nThe recursive properties of GraphQL make it incredibly powerful not just as a language to query stuff from a database, but also as an interesting tool that entire projects can be built upon.\nWe Decided to Build a Web Scraper\nAfter a lot of thought, we wanted to create a tool that would be useful to anyone and would leverage the recursive power of GraphQL to solve a problem in an interesting way. So we figured, why not build a web scraper that uses GraphQL? You could have a single query resolver called scrape that takes in a URL as a parameter and returns a generic defined entity such as an HtmlNode.\nWe wanted to make this tool fun to use and allow anyone to query for complex pieces of the DOM of any website by using graphql queries that are generated on the fly. Ideally, we wanted to be able to do something like:\n{\n  scrape(url: 'https://google.com') {\n    div(id: 'header') {\n      ul {\n        li {\n          a {\n            href\n            content\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis gives us a very visual representation of what’s being scraped from the page. However, we wanted to go even one step further with recursiveness and see if we could directly scrape all of the hyperlinks on a given page and fetch their info as well.\n{\n  scrape(url: 'https://google.com') {\n    links {\n      title\n      footer {\n        content\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nGiving us the ability to directly scrape the DOM from any external links in google’s home page! Extend this even more and we’d be able to scrape the entire Internet (well, not really but you get the idea :P)\nSo How Did We Do It?\nWe needed to leverage recursive types and some metaprogramming in the GraphQL.js npm package to get this working (link to the full repo is at the end).\nFirst, we setup a simple express server that has a graphql endpoint over HTTP that we can access directly through REST or through GraphiQL (a handy IDE explorer that Facebook created for us).\nimport express from 'express';\nimport cors from 'cors';\nimport graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';\n\nimport schema from './schema';\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(cors());\n\napp.use('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n graphqlHTTP({\n   schema: schema,\n   pretty: true,\n   graphiql: true,\n })(req, res);\n});\n\nconst port = 3010;\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n console.log(`app started on port ${port}`);\n});\n\nIn the code above, we imported our schema that defines all the types and queries in our GraphQL API and attached it to a library called graphqlHTTP. Let’s take a look at this schema file.\nimport {\n  graphql,\n  GraphQLSchema,\n  GraphQLObjectType,\n  GraphQLString\n} from 'graphql';\n\nimport { HtmlPage } from './resolvers';\n\nvar schema = new GraphQLSchema({\n  query: new GraphQLObjectType({\n    name: 'Query',\n    fields: {\n      scrape: {\n        type: HtmlPage,\n        // `args` describes the arguments that the `scrape` query accepts\n        args: {\n          url: { type: GraphQLString }\n        },\n        resolve: function (_, { url }) {\n          return {\n            url\n          };\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }),\n});\n\nexport default schema;\n\nHere we define the main Query type, which contains a single resolver called scrape. This is a query that returns an entity of type HtmlPage, takes in a url string as an argument, and allows us to continue writing subqueries from there. This is basically all we needed to get this started, but the really awesome part is in the actual HtmlPage recursive type.\nLet’s see what fields and queries that HtmlPage has available to it by looking at our final file: the resolvers of our GraphQL API. We’ll take it one step at a time, starting with some basic imports.\nimport cheerio from 'cheerio';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\n\nimport {\n  graphql,\n  GraphQLSchema,\n  GraphQLObjectType,\n  GraphQLString,\n  GraphQLInt,\n  GraphQLList\n} from 'graphql';\n\nWe need to define the actual base return type of our scrape query, which is the HtmlPage type. Initially, we want it to have some basic fields such as the url of the page, the hostname, and the title.\nexport const HtmlPage = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'HtmlPage',\n  fields: () =&gt; ({\n    url: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        return root.url;\n      }\n    },\n    hostname: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        const match = root.url.match(/^(https?\\:)\\/\\/(([^:\\/?#]*)(?:\\:([0-9]+))?)([\\/]{0,1}[^?#]*)(\\?[^#]*|)(#.*|)$/);\n        return match &amp;&amp; match[3];\n      }\n    },\n    title: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n        const res = await fetch(root.url);\n        const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n        return $('title').text();\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n\nIt would be cool if we could also fetch all the images on the page, so let’s add a field for that as well:\nexport const HtmlPage = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'HtmlPage',\n  fields: () =&gt; ({\n    images: {\n      type: new GraphQLList(GraphQLString),\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        return getImgsForUrl(root.url);\n      }\n    },\n    // all other fields below...\n    ...\n});\n\nconst getImgsForUrl = async (url) =&gt; {\n  const res = await fetch(url);\n  const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n  return $('img').map(function() { return $(this).attr('src'); }).get();\n};\n\nNow, we want to create a resolver for every valid DOM element that we can call on this HTMLPage type. For example, we want to be able to write:\n{\n  scrape('https://facebook.com') {\n    div {\n      span {\n        content\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis will allow us keep nesting our queries as much as we need to extract any content from a page. So let’s define our HtmlNode type first.\nconst validHtmlTags = [\n  'div'\n];\n\nconst validAttributes = {\n  id: { type: GraphQLString },\n  class: { type: GraphQLString },\n  src: { type: GraphQLString },\n  content: { type: GraphQLString },\n};\n\nconst HtmlNode = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'HtmlNode',\n  fields: htmlFields,\n});\n\nNow we need to define every field that the HtmlNode type will have, so we’ll do it by extending the validHtmlTags array to include any other tags we want and then converting that into an array of GraphQL resolvers as follows:\nconst htmlFields = () =&gt; validHtmlTags.reduce((prev, tag) =&gt; ({\n  ...prev,\n  [`${tag}`]: {\n    type: HtmlNode,\n    args: {\n      ...validAttributes,\n    },\n    resolve(root, args, context) {\n      const tagHistory = {\n        tag,\n        args,\n        url: root.url || root[0].url,\n      }\n      return [...root, here];\n    }\n  },\n  // some more stuff...\n  ...\n}), {});\n\nLet’s break down what’s going on here. We add a resolver for each tag in the validHtmlTags array that has a type of HtmlNode and a valid set of arguments (id, class, etc.) so we can do fancier and more specific DOM scraping. In order to finally fetch the content inside of this node, we need to keep track of all the other nodes above it so we can use tools such as Cheerio to recursively fetch their content.\nWe save the type of tag (div, span, etc.) and the arguments to its resolvers inside of an array called tagHistory that we then return in our resolver.\nThis means that when we query for\n{\n  scrape(url: 'google.com')\n    div {\n      div {\n        span {\n          content\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWe’ll be storing this nested query as an array that would look like:\nconst tagHistory = [ { tag: 'div' }, { tag: 'div' }, { tag: 'span' }]\n\nMaking it easy for us to parse this in our base case, a resolver called content that would return the text content inside of a certain HtmlNode. Let’s see how that would work.\nconst htmlFields = () =&gt; validHtmlTags.reduce((prev, tag) =&gt; ({\n  ...prev,\n  [`${tag}`]: {\n    type: HtmlNode,\n    args: {\n      ...validAttributes,\n    },\n    resolve(root, args, context) {\n      const tagHistory = {\n        tag,\n        args,\n        url: root.url || root[0].url,\n      }\n      return [...root, here];\n    }\n  },\n  content: {\n    type: GraphQLString,\n    resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n      const res = await fetch(root[0].url);\n      const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n      const selector = root.reduce((prev, curr) =&gt; {\n        let arg = '';\n        if(curr.args.id) {\n          arg = `#${curr.args.id}`;\n        } else if (curr.args.class) {\n          arg = `.${curr.args.class}`;\n        }\n\n        const ret = `${prev} ${curr.tag}${arg}`;\n        return ret;\n      }, '');\n      return $(selector).html();\n    }\n  }\n}), {});\n\nThe content resolver is the base case of our recursion. Here, root is going to be the tagHistory array that we created through all the nested queries, so we simply use node-fetch to make a GET request to the root URL we want to scrape.\nThen, we load it into cheerio, which is a JQuery library that works on the server. This reduce basically reduce the entire tagHistory array into a single JQuery selector string.\nIn this case, reducing the tagHistory array would give us the following string\n'div div span'\nand if we passed in the ID parameter or class parameter, we would get something like\n'div.navbar-container div.navbar-wrapper span.brand-logo'\nAt the very end, we simply call the JQuery function html() to fetch the inner content of the selector we created! It doesn’t stop there though…we finally need to plug this into the HtmlPage type we created in the beginning so that we’re able to query for these DOM elements. Here is the new HtmlPage type with its resolvers!\nexport const HtmlPage = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'HtmlPage',\n  fields: () =&gt; ({\n    // We add the htmlFields resolvers and types that we defined above\n    ...htmlFields(),\n    images: {\n      type: new GraphQLList(GraphQLString),\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        return getImgForUrl(root.url);\n      }\n    },\n    url: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        return root.url;\n      }\n    },\n    hostname: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        const match = root.url.match(/^(https?\\:)\\/\\/(([^:\\/?#]*)(?:\\:([0-9]+))?)([\\/]{0,1}[^?#]*)(\\?[^#]*|)(#.*|)$/);\n        return match &amp;&amp; match[3];\n      }\n    },\n    title: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n        const res = await fetch(root.url);\n        const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n        return $('title').text();\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n\nTo put a cherry on top, we added a resolver that would allow us to scrape all the hyperlinks in a page and return HtmlPage entities that we would also be able to run fancy queries on! Here’s how we did it:\nlinks: {\n  type: new GraphQLList(HtmlPage),\n  resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n    const res = await fetch(root.url);\n    const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n    const links = $('a').map(function() {\n      if (!$(this).attr('href')) {\n        return;\n      }\n      if ($(this).attr('href') !== '#' &amp;&amp; $(this).attr('href').indexOf('http') &gt; -1) {\n        return $(this).attr('href');\n      }\n    }).get();\n\n    return links.map(url =&gt; ({ url }))\n  }\n},\n\nPutting it all together, here’s our final resolver file:\nimport cheerio from 'cheerio';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\n\nimport {\n  graphql,\n  GraphQLSchema,\n  GraphQLObjectType,\n  GraphQLString,\n  GraphQLInt,\n  GraphQLList\n} from 'graphql';\n\nconst validAttributes = {\n  id: { type: GraphQLString },\n  class: { type: GraphQLString },\n  src: { type: GraphQLString },\n  content: { type: GraphQLString },\n};\n\nexport const validHTMLTags = [\n  'div',\n  'span',\n  'img',\n  'body',\n  'a',\n  'b',\n  'i',\n  'p',\n  'h1',\n  'h2',\n  'h3',\n  'article',\n  'footer',\n  'form',\n  'input',\n  'ul',\n  'li'\n];\n\nconst htmlFields = () =&gt; validHTMLTags.reduce((prev, tag) =&gt; ({\n  ...prev,\n  [`${tag}`]: {\n    type: HtmlNode,\n    args: {\n      ...validAttributes,\n    },\n    resolve(root, args, context) {\n      const here = {\n        tag,\n        args,\n        url: root.url || root[0].url,\n      }\n      return [...root, here];\n    }\n  },\n  content: {\n    type: GraphQLString,\n    resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n      const res = await fetch(root[0].url);\n      const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n      const selector = root.reduce((prev, curr) =&gt; {\n        let arg = '';\n        if(curr.args.id) {\n          arg = `#${curr.args.id}`;\n        } else if (curr.args.class) {\n          arg = `.${curr.args.class}`;\n        }\n\n        const ret = `${prev} ${curr.tag}${arg}`;\n        return ret;\n      }, '');\n      return $(selector).html();\n    }\n  }\n}), {});\n\nconst HtmlNode = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'HtmlNode',\n  fields: htmlFields,\n});\n\nconst getImgsForUrl = async (url) =&gt; {\n  const res = await fetch(url);\n  const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n  return $('img').map(function() { return $(this).attr('src'); }).get();\n};\n\nexport const HtmlPage = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'HtmlPage',\n  fields: () =&gt; ({\n    ...htmlFields(),\n    images: {\n      type: new GraphQLList(GraphQLString),\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        return getImgsForUrl(root.url);\n      }\n    },\n    links: {\n      type: new GraphQLList(HtmlPage),\n      resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n        const res = await fetch(root.url);\n        const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n        const links = $('a').map(function() {\n          if (!$(this).attr('href')) {\n            return;\n          }\n          if ($(this).attr('href') !== '#' &amp;&amp; $(this).attr('href').indexOf('http') &gt; -1) {\n            return $(this).attr('href');\n          }\n        }).get();\n\n        return links.map(url =&gt; ({ url }))\n      }\n    },\n    url: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        return root.url;\n      }\n    },\n    hostname: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve(root, args, context) {\n        const match = root.url.match(/^(https?\\:)\\/\\/(([^:\\/?#]*)(?:\\:([0-9]+))?)([\\/]{0,1}[^?#]*)(\\?[^#]*|)(#.*|)$/);\n        return match &amp;&amp; match[3];\n      }\n    },\n    title: {\n      type: GraphQLString,\n      resolve: async (root, args, context) =&gt; {\n        const res = await fetch(root.url);\n        const $ = cheerio.load(await res.text());\n        return $('title').text();\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n\nYou can check out the full repo at GraphQL Hackathon Github and install the dependencies with npm install.\nThen, run the code with npm start and navigate to http://localhost:3010/graphiql.

It is true that\nsetting up a node on mainnet today is easier than ever. However, developers often want to set up their own,\nlocal blockchain for testing purposes. We call these development networks or devnets.\nDevnets are critical for developers working on the protocol as well as smart contract developers that want to run their own chain using their own initial state. However, the latter need can be satisfied by tools such as \nFoundry which runs a “simulated” Ethereum environment that is \nenough for testing many contract interactions. \nNotwithstanding, more complex applications may want an environment that is closer to a real Ethereum blockchain,\nand setting up a local chain from scratch is the best approach. This blog post will help you understand \nhow to set up your own, local Ethereum chain from scratch that migrates to proof-of-stake in minutes.\nSetting up\nWith Ethereum switching to proof-of-stake, there are a bunch of buzzwords flying around:\n\n\"Consensus\", \"Execution\", \"the Merge\", What does it all mean???\n\nToday, running an Ethereum node means simply installing a client such as \ngo-ethereum and running a simple command to sync the chain. After\nthe switch to proof-of-stake, running an \"Ethereum node\" will require two components:\n\nexecution client software in charge of processing transactions and smart contracts. This is go-ethereum\nconsensus client software in charge of running the proof-of-stake logic. This tutorial will use the\nPrysm implemntation, which my team develops.\n\nPrysm is an open source, Go implementation of the Ethereum proof-of-stake protocol. It can be used to run a node+validator on mainnet and testnet environments with ease, and is highly configurable to meet users’ needs. \nEasy setup using Docker\nTo get started, install Docker and Docker Compose for your system. If you are on MacOS, you should adjust your settings on Docker desktop\nto provide more resources to your Docker containers. Go to Preferences -&gt; Resources and\ngive around 4 CPUs and 8Gb of memory if possible for a smooth installation.\nNext, clone a repository containing the configuration needed to run a local devnet with Docker here:\ngit clone https://github.com/rauljordan/eth-pos-devnet &amp;&amp; cd eth-pos-devnet\n\nFinally, simply run docker compose inside of the repository above.\ndocker-compose up -d\n\nBoom! Your network is up and running.\n$ docker-compose up -d\n[+] Running 7/7\n ⠿ Network eth-pos-devnet_default                          Created\n ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-geth-genesis-1                 Started\n ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-create-beacon-chain-genesis-1  Started\n ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-geth-account-1                 Started\n ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-geth-1                         Started\n ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-beacon-chain-1                 Started\n ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-validator-1                    Started\n\nYou will now be running a go-ethereum execution client, Prysm consensus client and a Prysm\nvalidator client in the background using Docker.\nNext, you can inspect the logs of the different services launched.\ndocker logs eth-pos-devnet-geth-1 -f\n\nYour go-ethereum node should look as follows:\n\nYour Prysm beacon node and validator client should also be functional:\n\nThis sets up a single node development network with 64 deterministically-generated validator keys to \ndrive the creation of blocks in an Ethereum proof-of-stake chain. Here's how it works:\n\nWe initialize a go-ethereum, proof-of-work development node from a genesis config\nWe initialize a Prysm beacon chain, proof-of-stake development node from a genesis config\nWe then start mining in go-ethereum, and concurrently run proof-of-stake using Prysm\nOnce the mining difficulty of the go-ethereum node reaches 50, the node switches to proof-of-stake mode by \nletting Prysm drive the consensus of blocks\n\nThe development net is fully functional and allows for the deployment of smart contracts and all the features \nthat also come with the Prysm consensus client such as its rich set of APIs for retrieving data from the blockchain. \nYou now have access to the normal, Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs on http://localhost:8545 and\nthe new consensus client APIs for the beacon chain on http://localhost:3500. You can see a list of available\nAPI endpoints for the beacon chain client here\nThis development net is a great way to understand the internals of Ethereum proof-of-stake and to mess around \nwith the different settings that make the system possible.\nManual setup built from source\nAll you will need for a manual installation guide is the Go programming language and git. Install the latest version of Go here, and verify your installation with:\ngo version\n\nYou should see an output showing you the version you have installed. Next, create a folder called devnet and change directory into it\nmkdir devnet &amp;&amp; cd devnet\n\nThe instructions below are running with Prysm commit cb9b5e8f6e91adc8c6cdb2ca39708703e88c0b63 and go-ethereum commit 890e2efca2111c790c6d5eb55e29981816ee1fe9\nClone the Prysm repository and build the following binaries. We’ll be outputting them to the devnet folder:\ngit clone https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm &amp;&amp; cd prysm\ngit checkout cb9b5e8f6e91adc8c6cdb2ca39708703e88c0b63\ngo build -o=../beacon-chain ./cmd/beacon-chain\ngo build -o=../validator ./cmd/validator\ngo build -o=../prysmctl ./cmd/prysmctl\ncd ..\n\nClone the go-ethereum repository and build it:\ngit clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum &amp;&amp; cd go-ethereum\ngit checkout 23ac8df15302bbde098cab6d711abdd24843d66a\nmake geth\ncp ./build/bin/geth ../geth\ncd ..\n\nYou will now have all the executables you need to run the the software for the devnet.\nConfiguration files\nYou will need configuration files for setting up Prysm and Go-Ethereum.\nPrysm\nOn the Prysm side, create a file called config.yml in your devnet folder containing the following:\nCONFIG_NAME: interop\nPRESET_BASE: interop\n\n# Genesis\nGENESIS_FORK_VERSION: 0x20000089\n\n# Altair\nALTAIR_FORK_EPOCH: 2\nALTAIR_FORK_VERSION: 0x20000090\n\n# Merge\nBELLATRIX_FORK_EPOCH: 4\nBELLATRIX_FORK_VERSION: 0x20000091\nTERMINAL_TOTAL_DIFFICULTY: 50\n\n# Time parameters\nSECONDS_PER_SLOT: 12\nSLOTS_PER_EPOCH: 6\n\n# Deposit contract\nDEPOSIT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: 0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242\n\nThe configuration above contains information about the different hard-fork versions that are required for Prysm to run, and has some custom parameters to make running your devnet easier. It’s important to note that you can change any of these settings as desired. To see the full list of configuration options you can change, see here.\nGo-Ethereum\nOn the go-ethereum side, you will need to set-up a private key that will help advance the chain from genesis by mining up until it reaches proof-of-stake mode. Create a file called secret.json inside of your devnet folder with the following:\n2e0834786285daccd064ca17f1654f67b4aef298acbb82cef9ec422fb4975622\n\nNext, save the following file as genesis.json inside of your devnet folder as well:\nThe file above sets up the genesis configuration for go-ethereum, which seeds certain accounts with an ETH balance and deploys a validator deposit contract at address 0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242 which is used for new validators to deposit 32 ETH and join the proof-of-stake chain. The account that we are running go-ethereum with, 0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524, will have an ETH balance you can use to submit transactions on your devnet.\nRunning the devnet\nGo-Ethereum\nNext, we will start by running go-ethereum in our devnet folder:\n./geth --datadir=gethdata init genesis.json\n./geth --datadir=gethdata account import sk.json\n\nThe last command will ask you to input a password for your secret key. You can just hit enter twice to leave it empty. Next, run geth using the command below\n./geth --http --http.api \"eth,engine\" --datadir=gethdata --allow-insecure-unlock --unlock=\"0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524\" --password=\"\" --nodiscover console --syncmode=full --mine\n\nYou can check the ETH balance in the geth console by typing in\neth.getBalance(\"0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524\") which should show 2e+22\nPrysm\nWe will then need to run a Prysm beacon node and a validator client. Prysm will need a genesis state which is essentially some data that tells it the initial set of validators. We will be creating a genesis state from a deterministic set of keys below:\n./prysmctl testnet generate-genesis --num-validators=64 --output-ssz=genesis.ssz --chain-config-file=config.yml\n\nThis will out a file genesis.ssz in your devnet folder. Now, run the Prysm beacon node soon after:\n./beacon-chain \\\n  --datadir=beacondata \\\n  --min-sync-peers=0 \\\n  --interop-genesis-state=genesis.ssz \\\n  --interop-eth1data-votes \\\n  --bootstrap-node= \\\n  --chain-config-file=config.yml \\\n  --config-file=config.yml \\\n  --chain-id=32382 \\\n  --execution-endpoint=http://localhost:8551 \\\n  --accept-terms-of-use \\\n  --jwt-secret=gethdata/geth/jwtsecret\n\nand the Prysm validator client soon after:\n./validator \\\n  --datadir=validatordata \\\n  --accept-terms-of-use \\\n  --interop-num-validators=64 \\\n  --interop-start-index=0 \\\n  --force-clear-db \\\n  --chain-config-file=config.yml \\\n  --config-file=config.yml\n\nExpected output\nYour go-ethereum node should look as follows:\n\nYour Prysm beacon node should show the following:\n\nThe errors are normal, cosmetic, and present on all devnet environments. We are working on making the output more aesthetically pleasing in the future.\nYour Prysm validator client should also be functional:\n\nUpon entering proof-of-stake mode, once the mining difficulty hits 50 in go-ethereum, you will see our special panda in your Prysm beacon chain below:\n\nAdding Prysm peers to your network\nYou can add additional, Prysm beacon chain peers to your proof-of-stake devnet by running the similar command as your first beacon node, but with a few tweaks. In a terminal window, use the following command:\ncurl localhost:8080/p2p\n\nYou should get output similar to this:\nbootnode=[]\nself=enr:-MK4QCxV5SEkUO1chqZDSqMChX5fTbqeas4PEJqZtzmcWqZOKpZN8ABVrQFTqHI74M9TKNjE6DPAAgyv5JydsQ6NfPqGAYKxymm8h2F0dG5ldHOI-7v9vd4GdE2EZXRoMpCMkQYoIAAAkf__________gmlkgnY0gmlwhAoAAEqJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQNZcfvPnVEfnKz-mFv285nkDzgRXRVujloXQ_tjuCNEbYhzeW5jbmV0cw-DdGNwgjLIg3VkcIIu4A,/ip4/10.0.0.74/tcp/13000/p2p/16Uiu2HAmJg9Sfy8bX4wyjZNTi8soJrdPt9E9pPzJSmewN5rLoRM6\n\n0 peers\n\nCopy the part that starts with /ip4 after the comma, so in the example above, \n/ip4/10.0.0.74/tcp/13000/p2p/16Uiu2HAmJg9Sfy8bX4wyjZNTi8soJrdPt9E9pPzJSmewN5rLoRM6\nthen set this as an environment variable:\nexport PEER=/ip4/10.0.0.74/tcp/13000/p2p/16Uiu2HAmJg9Sfy8bX4wyjZNTi8soJrdPt9E9pPzJSmewN5rLoRM6\n\nThen, run a second Prysm beacon node as follows:\n./beacon-chain \\\n  --datadir=beacondata2 \\\n  --min-sync-peers=1 \\\n  --interop-genesis-state=genesis.ssz \\\n  --interop-eth1data-votes \\\n  --bootstrap-node= \\\n  --chain-config-file=config.yml \\\n  --config-file=config.yml \\\n  --chain-id=32382 \\\n  --execution-endpoint=http://localhost:8551 \\\n  --accept-terms-of-use \\\n  --rpc-port=4001 \\\n  --p2p-tcp-port=13001 \\\n  --p2p-udp-port=12001 \\\n  --grpc-gateway-port=3501 \\\n  --monitoring-port=8001 \\\n  --jwt-secret=gethdata/geth/jwtsecret \\\n  --peer=$PEER\n\nYou will see the node start to synchronize with the chain as expected!\n\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/how-to-setup-a-proof-of-stake-devnet/","title":"How to Set Up an Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Devnet in Minutes "},"https://rauljordan.com/how-to-write-an-event-feed-library/":{"body":"type sub struct {\n    feed         *BoolFeed\n    channelIndex int\n    channel      chan bool\n    once         sync.Once\n    err          chan error\n}\n\nThis blog post explores the design rationale behind building a performant, simple, one-to-many event feed library in Go. We'll be recreating the event library from the go-ethereum project step by step, even explaining some of the tricky design decisions behind its robust concurrency approach. \nPing Pong\nWhen I first started learning Go, I didn't truly understand the fantastic concurrency primitives the language provides. Most real world applications tend to be concurrent and asynchronous...meaning all sorts of things can and will happen simultaneously and at different time intervals, often beyond our control. A big challenge when building concurrent applications is then the control and flow of shared state information, often becoming a very complex problem. In Go, communication between concurrent threads happens through special data structures called channels, which are typed and allow for a basic \"sender\" vs. \"listener\" design pattern. This pattern, as we'll soon see, is more expressive than it seems, giving Go one of the strongest toolkits to handle even the most complex concurrency challenges.\nLet's take a look at a basic example:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan string)\n    go ping(ch)\n    go pong(ch)\n    select {}\n}\n\nfunc ping(ch chan string) {\n    for {\n        time.Sleep(time.Second)\n        fmt.Println(\"Sending message...\")\n        ch &lt;- \"ping\"\n    }\n}\n\nfunc pong(ch chan string) {\n    for {\n        select {\n        case p :=&lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Printf(\"Received message %s\\n\", p)\n            if p == \"ping\" {\n                fmt.Println(\"pong\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the example above, we created two functions, ping and pong. The first one sends the \"ping\" message over a string typed channel, while the other listens for and receives the message, checking its value, and logging \"pong\" accordingly. We spawn off both functions concurrently using the go keyword, which creates a lightweight thread called a goroutine that runs alongside the main thread of the program. Having channels abstracts away the complexity of goroutine communication, making users unaware of the concurrency details happening underneath the hood and leaving us to simply focus on our core application logic.\n\nGotchas: Buffered vs. Unbuffered Channels\nWhen creating a Go channel, we have the option of making it either buffered or unbuffered. An unbuffered channel is initialized with a simple make call along with its type, make(chan bool). A buffered channel instead specifies a buffer length, such as make(chan bool, 5). Think of channels as the mailman, bringing packages all across the neighborhood. The buffer is the the capacity of his mailbag, containing all the envelopes. The mailman will wait till his bag is full before making a trip to deliver the letters. Whenever you specify a buffered channel, that's what happens. Essentially, data is kept in the buffer until it fills up to capacity, and at that point a listener or receiver can read all of the information contains in the channel. An unbuffered channel, however, has a capacity of 0, so it can't store data. Every send over an unbuffered channel must have a recipient ready to process the send right away.\nLet's take a look at a basic unbuffered example:\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan string)\n    go func() {\n        ch &lt;- \"hello world\"\n    }()\n    msg := &lt;-ch\n    fmt.Println(msg)\n}\n\nWe create a listener over our basic, unbuffered channel and log once we receive it, great! If we run this program we see our little \"hello world\" pop up on our terminal window. If we never send, the program will wait forever, given the recipient will hang there never receiving a message to proceed into the Println statement.\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan string, 1)\n    go func() {\n        ch &lt;- \"hello world\"\n    }()\n    msg := &lt;-ch\n    fmt.Println(msg)\n}\n\nWhat happens if we try to send and receive in the same goroutine with an unbuffered channel?\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan string)\n    ch &lt;- \"hello world\"\n    msg := &lt;-ch\n    fmt.Println(msg)\n}\n\nRunning...\n$ go run main.go\nfatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\n\ngoroutine 1 [chan send]:\nmain.main()\n\n\nYikes! Well the issue is pretty clear here, as there's no listener, the channel will block the main thread on sending, preventing it from advancing at all! Even if we add a listener right beneath the send, we will get the same error because the code can never proceed past ch &lt;- \"hello world\", as the send call never even completes. There must already be a listener prepared to receive when the send is called. \n\nYou cannot send and receive from an unbuffered channel in the same goroutine, as there needs to be a receiver ready before you send anything out!\n\nThe code above works if we initialize our channel with a buffer ch := make(chan string, 1), as the channel will then store the data until a listener reads it even if there is no listener ready at the time of sending.\nWhy Buffered Channels Are Great\nBuffered channels have a fundamentally different use case than unbuffered ones, as by their very nature, they're well-suited to handle aggregation of information across goroutines. For example, say you're creating a concurrent web scraper that tries to scrape a ton of websites at the same time, and eventually you want to aggregate the results into some nice form for final processing. If you know the list of websites you'll be scraping ahead of time, you can create a buffered channel of that length, do the heavy lifting across a bunch of concurrent goroutines, and write the results to this channel. When you're done, a listener will be ready to loop over the aggregated results and handle them accordingly. Let's take a look:\ntype ScrapedData struct {\n    Url      string\n    Html     string\n    NumLinks int\n}\n\nfunc scrapeSite(s string) *ScrapedData {\n    // Do some intense data scraping...\n    htmlResult := getHtmlResults(s)\n    numLinks := getNumLinks(htmlResult)\n    ...\n    return &amp;ScrapedData{\n        Url: s,\n        Html:     htmlResults,\n        NumLinks: numLinks,\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    websites := []string{\"example.com\", \"wikipedia.org\"}\n    ch := make(chan *ScrapedData, len(websites))\n\n    for i := 0; i &lt; len(websites); i++ {\n        go func(ii int) {\n            ch &lt;- scrapeSite(websites[ii])\n        }(i)\n    }\n\n    for val := range ch {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Scraped %s with number of links %d\\n\", val.Url, val.NumLinks)\n    }\n}\n\nUsing the concepts from before, we declare a buffered channel of type *ScrapedData. Then, for every website, we spawn off a goroutine that does some heavy data scraping and writes the result to the channel. In the end, we loop over the results and print out every single value we just scraped. Does the code above run? Let's see:\n$ go run main.go\nScraped example.com with number of links 10\nScraped wikipedia.org with number of links 20\nfatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\n\ngoroutine 1 [chan receive]:\nmain.main()\n\nShoot - what the heck happened here? As it turns out, Go's range function isn't smart enough to figure out we're done writing into the channel, and that's not its fault! Given we're building some concurrent application, there could be some other routine that tries to keep writing into the channel, so there's no way for range to know we're done writing, even if the channel is filled up to the brim. Instead, once we're done writing and we're sure of it, we should call Go's built-in close operator to close the channel off for future communication.\nfunc main() {\n    websites := []string{\"example.com\", \"wikipedia.org\"}\n    ch := make(chan *ScrapedData, len(websites))\n\n    for i := 0; i &lt; len(websites); i++ {\n        go func(ii int) {\n            ch &lt;- scrapeSite(websites[ii])\n        }(i)\n    }\n\n    close(ch)\n\n    for val := range ch {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Scraped %s with number of links %d\\n\", val.Url, val.NumLinks)\n    }\n}\n\nTurns out this eliminates the deadlock error, but nothing else gets printed out...what gives? Concurrent applications are often asynchronous, meaning we don't know when they'll complete relative to other threads and we should not make any assumptions regarding this. In the code above, when we spawn off two goroutines, the main thread keeps going, there's nothing stopping it! So the close call might have happened way before we attempt to scrape the data, leaving us in a weird spot. As a solution, Go provides an awesome tool called a WaitGroup, which lets us block threads until a specified number of goroutines complete.\nfunc main() {\n    websites := []string{\"example.com\", \"wikipedia.org\"}\n    ch := make(chan *ScrapedData, len(websites))\n\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\n    wg.Add(len(websites))\n    for i := 0; i &lt; len(websites); i++ {\n        go func(ii int, w *sync.WaitGroup) {\n            ch &lt;- scrapeSite(websites[ii])\n            w.Done()\n        }(i, &amp;wg)\n    }\n\n    wg.Wait()\n    close(ch)\n\n    for val := range ch {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Scraped %s with number of links %d\\n\", val.Url, val.NumLinks)\n    }\n}\n\nUsing a wait group, we can tell the program \"hey, we have 2 goroutines that are scheduled, wait until they're finished before proceeding\". When the goroutine finishes, we can call wg.Done() to notify the wait group. Note we pass in a reference to the wait group in the goroutine's arguments to ensure we don't make a different copy of the wait group we initialized. Now, when we run the code again, we'll wait till all routines complete before we close off the channel, and we should have a fully functional program now with wait groups, fancy buffered channels, and even a range loop to read the aggregated data results :).\n$ go run main.go\nScraped example.com with number of links 10\nScraped wikipedia.org with number of links 20\n\nOne-to-Many Subscriptions\nNow that we reviewed buffered and unbuffered channels as well as goroutines, let's see what else this powerful construct allows us to build. So far, we've only seen single sender vs. receiver patterns, where there's a single listener waiting for results sent into some channel. But what if we want many listeners to receive the same data and do something with it simultaneously? This should work, right?\nvar userID = 0\n\ntype UserInfo struct {\n    ID int\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan *UserInfo)\n    go simulateUserSignup(ch)\n    go sendEmail(ch)\n    go saveUserToDB(ch)\n    select {}\n}\n\nfunc simulateUserSignup(ch chan *UserInfo) {\n    for {\n        time.Sleep(time.Second)\n        ch &lt;- &amp;UserInfo{\n            ID: userID,\n        }\n        userID++\n    }\n}\n\nfunc sendEmail(ch chan *UserInfo) {\n    for {\n        select {\n        case user := &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Printf(\"Sending confirmation email to user with ID %d...\\n\", user.ID)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc saveUserToDB(ch chan *UserInfo) {\n    for {\n        select {\n        case user := &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Printf(\"Saving user data to database with ID %d...\\n\", user.ID)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe output...\n$ go run main.go\nSaving user data to database with ID 0...\nSending confirmation email to user with ID 1...\nSaving user data to database with ID 2...\nSending confirmation email to user with ID 3...\nSaving user data to database with ID 4...\nSending confirmation email to user with ID 5...\nSaving user data to database with ID 6...\nSending confirmation email to user with ID 7...\nSaving user data to database with ID 8...\n\nOh no...we really don't that to happen. We want both the sending of a confirmation email + the saving a user to the DB to happen together, not skipping every other user! Turns out, naïve channels don't exactly work when you need a one-to-many subscription pattern. We could indeed rearchitect the code above to instead listen once and perform both actions sequentially and synchronously:\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan *UserInfo)\n    go simulateUserSignup(ch)\n    for {\n        select {\n        case user := &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Printf(\"Saving user data to database with ID %d...\\n\", user.ID)\n            // Perform the db save...\n            fmt.Printf(\"Sending confirmation email to user with ID %d...\\n\", user.ID)\n            // Send the confirmation email...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd sure, this is the best solution if your entire application is a single event loop, but more complex applications typically have various services running concurrently with their own event loops, and having everything work in this synchronous pattern isn't always the best. Sometimes, we want to simply trigger events in our applications without worrying too much about who's listening, with the possibility of having infinitely many listeners that can conditionally subscribe to the event notification. This common pattern is conventionally referred to as PubSub. A naïve implementation of a one-to-many pubsub with a single channel won't work for this use case, as we see above, there can only be at most 1 listener that receives a single send at any given time. However, can we use these channel primitives to come with a one-to-many implementation that is simple and robust enough to use in production?\nDesigning a Subscription and Event Feed Model\nWe're going to be designing a Feed data structure that allows many listeners to subscribe to a single event sent over the feed and receive them as they happen. First, let's outline some feature requirements we'd like to see in any library that implements this pubsub model using Go:\n\nWe want a generic library, I want to be able to trigger events with any sort of data, regardless of its type\nWe want the ability for many subscribers to listen for event triggers of a specific type, each receiving the sent data simultaneously as it occurs\nWe want the ability for subscribers to unsubscribe whenever they need to, preventing future events being received by such listener\nWe want a library that is easy to use, idiomatic, and uses Go's concurrency primitives effectively\nWe want a library that is light on memory, performance, and is thread-safe\n\nA First Pass Implementation\nSo, where do we start? A good design typically begins by identifying the key invariants of necessary features. We want to focus first on the core desired functionality, which is to allow for one-to-many subscriptions of triggered events. To keep things simple, our first implementation will only allow for bool type event subscriptions, so let's call our feed a BoolFeed.\nGiven a single channel send can only receive data by at most one listener, why don't we allow our library to send to a bunch of registered channels simultaneously? That is, we can allow listeners to register a channel they want to be notified through, and as we trigger a new event, we send data over all the registered channels via a for loop. Let's give that a shot:\ntype BoolFeed struct {\n    lock sync.Mutex\n    listeners []chan bool\n}\n\nfunc (f *BoolFeed) Send(data bool) {\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    for _, lis := range f.listeners {\n        lis&lt;-data\n    }\n    f.lock.Unlock()\n}\n\nfunc (f *BoolFeed) RegisterListener(lis chan bool) {\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    f.listeners = append(f.listeners, lis)\n    f.lock.Unlock()\n}\n\nfunc firstListener(f *BoolFeed) {\n    ch := make(chan bool)\n    f.RegisterListener(ch)\n    for {\n        select {\n        case &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Println(\"Received data in first listener\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc secondListener(f *BoolFeed) {\n    ch := make(chan bool)\n    f.RegisterListener(ch)\n    for {\n        select {\n        case &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Println(\"Received data in second listener\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    feed := &amp;BoolFeed{\n        listeners: make([]chan bool, 0),\n    }\n\n    go func(ff *BoolFeed) {\n        for {\n            time.Sleep(time.Second)\n            ff.Send(true)\n        }\n    }(feed)\n\n    go firstListener(feed)\n    go secondListener(feed)\n    select {}\n}\n\nWe use a mutex above to make the operations thread safe, preventing calls to RegisterListener from happening at the exact same time as we're doing a send of the data over the currently registered channels. We run the code, and...\n$ go run main.go\nReceived data in second listener\nReceived data in first listener\nReceived data in second listener\nReceived data in first listener\nReceived data in first listener\n\nIt works, we see data being properly received by the different listeners. Even though we get the result we expected in this contrived example, our naïve approach still has a critical limitation that makes it unsuitable for production which we'll analyze in the next sections.\nFor now, let's see if we can meet another invariant in our features requirement, which is to unsubscribe from the event triggers whenever want to. For this, we can define a Subscription type, which contains an Unsubscribe() method, and which can be returned by the RegisterListener function. As a subscriber, we don't care about how this unsubscribing by itself works underneath the hood, we just need to have it as an option. For easier testing and implementation, we can define subscriptions as a Go interface:\ntype Subscription interface {\n    Unsubscribe()\n}\n\nand amend our BoolFeed as follows:\nfunc (f *BoolFeed) RegisterListener() Subscription\n\nWhile we're at it, let's make our implementation more idiomatic and rename RegisterListener to Subscribe to end up with:\nfunc (f *BoolFeed) Subscribe(ch chan bool) Subscription {\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc someListener(feed *BoolFeed) {\n    ch := make(chan bool)\n    sub := feed.Subscribe(ch)\n    defer sub.Unsubscribe()\n    for {\n        select {\n        case &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Println(\"Received data in first listener\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBut what if the feed we're subscribed to all of a sudden has problems, or maybe it belongs to another service that shuts down, how would we know? Indeed, every subscription should have an error channel that we can also listen for and unsubscribe if needed.\ntype Subscription interface {\n    Unsubscribe()\n    Err() &lt;-chan error\n}\n\nfunc someListener(feed *BoolFeed) {\n    ch := make(chan bool)\n    sub := feed.Subscribe(ch)\n    defer sub.Unsubscribe()\n    for {\n        select {\n        case &lt;-ch:\n            fmt.Println(\"Received data in first listener\")\n        case err:=&lt;-sub.Err():\n            fmt.Printf(\"Oh no - something went wrong: %v\", err)\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow we have an easy, standard pattern to safely subscribe to and unsubscribe from events should errors occur as we listen for data. As we implement our Unsubscribe() function, we should ensure it can only occur once to prevent accidental duplicate calls to have detrimental effects.\n...\n\nfunc (f *BoolFeed) Subscribe(lis chan bool) Subscription {\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    defer f.lock.Unlock()\n    f.listeners = append(f.listeners, lis)\n    return &amp;sub{\n        feed: f,\n        channelIndex: len(f.listeners)-1,\n        channel: lis,\n        err: make(chan error, 1),\n    }\n}\n\n// removes an channel at index i efficiently as order does not\n// matter for listeners we keep track of.\nfunc (f *BoolFeed) remove(i int) {\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    f.listeners[i] = f.listeners[len(f.listeners)-1]\n    f.listeners = f.listeners[:len(f.listeners)-1]\n    f.lock.Unlock()\n}\n\ntype sub struct {\n    feed    *BoolFeed\n    channelIndex int\n    channel chan bool\n    once sync.Once\n    err     chan error\n}\n\nfunc (s *sub) Unsubscribe() {\n    s.once.Do(func() {\n        s.feed.remove(s.channelIndex)\n        close(sub.err)\n    })\n}\n\nfunc (s *sub) Err() &lt;-chan error {\n    return s.sub\n}\n\nLet's digest what's going on above. First, we returned a &amp;sub{...} from our Subscribe func, storing some information about the channel's index in the listeners, and we also initialize a useful err channel as a buffered channel. Remember how buffered channels don't block a thread on a send? Well, imagine that the error listener all of a sudden disappears for whatever reason, then if we were writing over an unbuffered channel, we'd have a send call that can never complete, causing us to have memory leakage! This is dangerous thing, as it leads to some of the most silent but deadly bugs you can have in an application. Having a buffered channel of size one ensures that a send over it will be non-blocking.\nIn our Unsubscribe function, we use the helpful sync.Once helper from the standard library to ensure we run the function once and only once. We remove the channel from the feed's internal list of listeners and then close our buffered sub channel to wrap things up nicely. Another interesting to note is the function signature for the Err() &lt;-chan error func. Specifying &lt;-chan error basically tells whomever uses this function that the returned channel is only capable of receiving data, preventing any external sends into the error channel. So far, our first implementation meets most of the invariants we defined above, but it's still not generic...let's fix that.\nNext Steps: A Generic Event Feed\n\nAlthough Go itself doesn't have built in generic functions, we can still define functions that take in the empty interface interface{}, and use the reflect package from the standard library to perform operations based on the exact type and value passed in. Let's see what we can do by defining a fully generic Feed.\ntype Feed struct {\n    lock sync.Mutex\n    sending chan struct{}\n    sendCases []reflect.SelectCase\n}\n\nfunc (f *Feed) Subscribe(ch interface{}) (Subscription, error) {\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    defer f.lock.Unlock()\n    val := reflect.ValueOf(ch)\n    chanTyp := val.Type()\n    if chanTyp.Kind() != reflect.Chan {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"wanted channel type as input, received %v\", chanTyp)\n    }\n    cs := reflect.SelectCase{Dir: reflect.SelectSend, Chan: val}\n    f.sendCases = append(f.sendCases, cs)\n    return &amp;sub{\n        feed: f,\n        channelIndex: len(f.sendCases)-1,\n        channel: val,\n        err: make(chan error, 1),\n    }\n}\n\nNow, we can accept any generic channel, and instead of keeping track of []chan bool, we now keep track of []reflect.SelectCase, what does this mean? From Godocs, we see there it's a useful wrapper in the standard library for keeping track of a channel and whether or not it is send-only or receive-only, which will be helpful later.\nIn our Send function, we can now accept any value by attempting to send over the tracked channels:\nfunc (f *Feed) Send(value interface{}) {\n    rvalue := reflect.ValueOf(value)\n    &lt;-f.sending\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    for _, cs := range f.sendCases {\n        // Set the sent value on all channels.\n        cs.Send = rvalue\n        cs.TrySend(rvalue)\n    }\n    f.lock.Unlock()\n    f.sending &lt;- struct{}{}\n}\n\nWe use sending chan struct{} as a way to protect the Send function and make it fully thread safe, as there could be many calls to Send occurring at the same time, we want to ensure they can only happen sequentially.\nA Critical Problem With Our Approach\nIt seems like now we met most of our invariants, but what's critically wrong from the code above? It seems simple enough, no? Consider the first section of this blog post where we talked about the merits of unbuffered vs. buffered channels as well as typical gotchas regarding them. Well, when we attempt to subscribe any generic channel into our Feed data structure using the code above, we have no way of determinining whether the channel is buffered or not. That is, we cannot determine if some operations will block on send while others will not, and that will lead to chaos if we try to use our naïve approach at runtime. Plus, keep in mind we deliver data to listeners by doing a simple for loop over a list of registered channels and performing a send operation, but what if we have the following registered listeners:\n[\n    make(chan bool, 2),\n    make(chan bool),\n    make(chan bool, 1)\n]\n\nAny attempt to do:\ncs.TrySend(rvalue)\n\n...will succeed on the first channel's send, but block the thread on the second if there is no active listener, and remember one of our invariants was that the sender should not care about who's listening or their status, but this invariably leads to a major problem.\nCan we do better?\nTowards a Smarter, Non-Blocking Approach\nInstead of trying once and possibly failing, we must keep trying to send the data over every listener until all of them either:\n\n(a) succeed, or...\n(b) some of them unsubscribe themselves from the feed\n\nThe TrySend function can actually fail and returns a bool value of false if the channel we are sending to has a full buffer, in which case our logic above does not work. Instead of keeping a single slice of channels we should send over, we can keep two slices: one for channels we have yet to attempt to send, and another for channels we finished sending over. Let's call the former pendingProcessing and the other inProgress.\ntype Feed struct {\n    lock sync.Mutex\n    pendingProcessing []reflect.SelectCase\n    inProgress []reflect.SelectCase\n}\n\nWe should have a while loop which proceeds until all inProgress cases have been marked as done, and if some of the receiving channels are blocked, we should wait in each iteration of the loop until they unblock before attempting to send again. Here's a bit of pseudocode of how this could work:\nprocessing = feed.in_progress\nwhile:\n    for case in processing:\n        # If the channel is blocking, this will fail!\n        if case.try_send:\n            cases = cases.mark_succeded(case)\n    if len(cases) == 0:\n        break\n    # For cases that failed and were not marked as succeeded, we pseudo-randomly\n    # pick one of them, block with a select statement, and wait for it to unblock\n    # and receive our data. Then, we mark it as succeeded.\n    chosen = wait_for_unblocked_and_send(cases)\n    cases = cases.mark_succeded(chosen)\n\n\nWith the logic above, eventually every single in progress case will complete and will get data sent over its channel. Next, we need a function which will deactivate cases from the inProgress slice as we successfully send over them, the mark_succeeded function from our pseudocode above.\n// removes an channel at index i efficiently as order does not\n// matter for listeners we keep track of.\nfunc deactivate(cs []reflect.SelectCase, index int) []reflect.SelectCase {\n    last := len(cs) - 1\n    cs[index], cs[last] = cs[last], cs[index]\n    return cs[:last]\n}\n\nWe name the function deactivate as it basically removes an item at an index from the slice of cases we are attempting to send over. Once the send succeeds, we deactivate the case.\nfunc (f *Feed) Send(value interface{}) (nsent int) {\n    rvalue := reflect.ValueOf(value)\n    &lt;-f.sending\n\n    // Add new cases from the pendingProcessing slice after taking the send lock.\n    f.lock.Lock()\n    f.inProgress = append(f.inProgress, f.pendingProcessing...)\n    f.pendingProcessing = nil\n    f.lock.Unlock()\n\n    // Set the Send value on all channels.\n    for i := firstSubSendCase; i &lt; len(f.inProgress); i++ {\n        f.inProgress[i].Send = rvalue\n    }\n\n    // Send until all channels have been chosen. 'cases' tracks a prefix\n    // of inProgress. When a send succeeds, the corresponding case moves to the end of\n    // 'cases' and it shrinks by one element.\n    cases := f.inProgress\n    for {\n        // Try sending without blocking before adding to the select set.\n        // This should usually succeed if subscribers are fast enough and have free\n        // buffer space.\n        for i := 0; i &lt; len(cases); i++ {\n            if cases[i].Chan.TrySend(rvalue) {\n                nsent++\n                cases = cases.deactivate(i)\n                i--\n            }\n        }\n        if len(cases) == 0 {\n            break\n        }\n        // Select on all the receivers, waiting for them to unblock.\n        chosen, _, _ := reflect.Select(cases)\n        cases = cases.deactivate(chosen)\n        nsent++\n    }\n\n    // Forget about the sent value.\n    for i := 0; i &lt; len(f.inProgress); i++ {\n        f.inProgress[i].Send = reflect.Value{}\n    }\n    f.sending &lt;- struct{}{}\n    return nsent\n}\n\nWhat's going on over here? Well, from the pseudocode from earlier, if TrySend fails, we'll go into the latter part of our for loop, which will use reflect.Select(cases), which pretty much simulates a real, blocking select block in Go!\nselect {\ncase waitTillUnblocked(someChan):\n    someChan &lt;- data\n}\n\nThis will pseudorandomly pick one of the channels which did not succeed, block the thread until the channel is unblocked, and then send the data over it. With this, we have all the pieces needed to test this out and make sure it fits our invariants. If we try running\nTesting &amp; Benchmarks\nHow does one even begin to test something like this? With channels of course! Given we have a lot of concurrency, we will have to be careful with our test setup to avoid any deadlocks or goroutine leaks, all while ensuring we properly test the behavior of our functions. Let's try to setup a test to ensure the one-to-many functionality invariant of our library is met.\nfunc TestFeed_OneToMany(t *testing.T) {\n    feed := &amp;Feed{\n        pendingProcessing: make([]reflect.SelectCase, 0),\n        inProgress:        make([]reflect.SelectCase, 0),\n    }\n\n    var done, subscribed sync.WaitGroup\n    // We create a wait group for subscribing and a wait group for completing\n    // the receipt of the value.\n    numRoutines := 10\n    done.Add(numRoutines)\n    subscribed.Add(numRoutines)\n    for i := 0; i &lt; numRoutines; i++ {\n        go func() {\n            defer done.Done()\n            ch := make(chan bool, 0)\n            sub, err := feed.Subscribe(ch)\n            defer sub.Unsubscribe()\n            if err != nil {\n                t.Fatal(err)\n            }\n            // We notify the wait group we finished subscribing.\n            subscribed.Done()\n            select {\n            case val := &lt;-ch:\n                t.Logf(\"Received value in listener %d: %v\", i, val)\n                return\n            case err := &lt;-sub.Err():\n                t.Errorf(\"Received error in listener %d: %v\", i, err)\n                return\n            }\n        }()\n    }\n\n    // We wait for all subscriptions to be completed before we send anything out.\n    subscribed.Wait()\n    if nsent := feed.Send(true); nsent != numRoutines {\n        t.Errorf(\"First send delivered %d times, wanted %d\", nsent, numRoutines)\n    }\n    // We wait for the values to be received before finishing the test.\n    done.Wait()\n}\n\nIn the example above, we simply setup 10 subscribers which are waiting to receive\ninformation on a subscribed channel they initialized. We create two wait groups so we can\nwait for the subscriptions to be registered and for the subscribers to receive the values. We simply do a feed.Send and finally the number of sends matches the number of goroutines - simple enough!\nLet's see how a benchmark would work here.\nfunc BenchmarkFeed_Send(b *testing.B) {\n    feed := &amp;Feed{\n        pendingProcessing: make([]reflect.SelectCase, 0),\n        inProgress:        make([]reflect.SelectCase, 0),\n    }\n    numRoutines := 1000\n\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\n    wg.Add(numRoutines)\n    for i := 0; i &lt; numRoutines; i++ {\n        ch := make(chan int, numRoutines)\n        feed.Subscribe(ch)\n        go func(cc chan int) {\n            for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {\n                &lt;-cc\n            }\n            done.Done()\n        }(ch)\n    }\n\n    b.ResetTimer()\n    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {\n        if feed.Send(i) != numRoutines {\n            b.Fatal(\"Incorrect number of sends\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    b.StopTimer()\n    done.Wait()\n}\n\nThe results only make 1 allocation per operation as we initialize a channel, but we do see quite a few ns/operation of running our Send function:\n$ go test -bench=. -benchmem\ngoos: darwin\ngoarch: amd64\nBenchmarkFeed_Send-4   \t   10000\t    252560 ns/op\t      13 B/op\t       1 allocs/op\nPASS\n\nWe can wrap this up! So we ended up doing a whirlwind tour of buffered vs. unbuffered channels, learned about goroutines and deadlock, and finally ended up recreating the event library used by the go-ethereum and the Prysm project, hopefully making concurrency a bit less intimidating, one step at a time :). The finalized event feed library from the prior section looks very similar to the Go-Ethereum Feed implementation so feel free to use it as a reference and try to run it yourself!\nOther Recommended Readings\n\nBuffered Channels in Go\nAnatomy of a Go Channel\n\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/how-to-write-an-event-feed-library/","title":"Writing an One-to-Many Event Feed Library in Go"},"https://rauljordan.com/immutability-patterns-in-go/":{"body":"for field, ref := range s.sharedFieldReferences {\n    ref.AddRef()\n    dst.sharedFieldReferences[field] = ref\n}\n\nOne of cons of Go as a modern programming language is the lack of native options for making certain data structures immutable. That is, we often have to make key software design decisions in our application just to ensure certain data is immutable throughout the code's runtime, and it may not look pretty. At my company, Prysmatic Labs, we often encounter the problem where we need to maintain certain large data structures in-memory for performance reasons and we also need to perform one-off, local computations on such data. That is, we have very intensive read-heavy workloads in our application where we do not want to compromise data safety.\n\n\nA concrete example of this is in the field of distributed systems, where servers typically maintain some global \"state\" which other computers on the network also maintain through a consensus algorithm. An example of this is Ethereum, a popular blockchain my team develops, which maintains a global state of user accounts, balances and tons of other critical information. These applications are state machines, which update their state through a state transition function: a pure function which takes in some data, the global state, and outputs a new global state in a deterministic fashion.\nLet's give a basic example:\ntype State struct {\n    AccountAddresses []string\n    Balances         []uint64\n}\n\ntype InputData struct {\n    Transfers           []*Transfer\n    NewAccountAddresses []string\n    NewAccountBalances  []uint64\n}\n\ntype Transfer struct {\n    From   string\n    To     string\n    Amount uint64\n}\n\n// ExecuteStateTransition is a pure function which received some input data,\n// a pre-state, and outputs a deterministic post-state if the inputs are valid.\nfunc ExecuteStateTransition(data *InputData, preState *State) (*State, error) {\n    var err error\n    for _, transfer := range data.Transfers {\n        // Apply a transfer to the state.\n        preState, err = applyTransfer(preState, transfer)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"could not apply transfer to accounts: %v\", err)\n        }\n    }\n    if len(data.NewAccountAddresses) != len(data.NewAccountBalances) {\n        return nil, errors.New(\"different number of new account addresses and balances\")\n    }\n    for i, address := range data.NewAccountAddresses {\n        balance := data.NewAccountBalances[i]\n        preState, err = addAccount(preState, address, balance)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"could not create new account in state: %v\", err)\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n    // Do some other fancy stuff...\n    return preState, nil\n}\n\nIn these applications, a state transition may fail, which will leave the state object in an inconsistent state! For example, your code might fail:\nif len(data.NewAccountAddresses) != len(data.NewAccountBalances) {\n    return nil, errors.New(\"different number of new account addresses and balances\")\n}\n\nDespite already having mutated accounts in the state in the preceding lines:\nvar err error\nfor _, transfer := range data.Transfers {\n    // Apply a transfer to the state.\n    preState, err = applyTransfer(preState, transfer)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"could not apply transfer to accounts: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n\nNaive Solution: Full Copy\nA simple, yet naïve way to solve the problem is to enforce full copying of data before the function runs. For example:\nfunc (s *Server) NaiveCopy() *State {\n    newAccountAddresses := make([]string, len(s.accountAddresses))\n    copy(newAccountAddresses, s.accountAddresses)\n    newBalances := make([]uint64, len(s.balances))\n    copy(newBalances, s.balances)\n    return &amp;State{\n        accountAddresses: newAccountAddresses,\n        balances:         newBalances,\n    }\n}\n\n...\n// Retrieve a copy of the current application state.\npreState := s.NaiveCopy()\npostState, err := ExecuteStateTransition(data, preState)\nif err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"could not process state transition: %v\", err)\n}\n...\n\nThis means the state transition function will be operating on a locally scoped, 100% copied instance of the data instead of mutating our precious, real state. However, this is a bad choice when the state might be a massive data structure and also a bad choice depending on how many times the state transition function might run. The fact that we need to copy the entire data structure is a bad pattern that will not scale to real applications. Deep copies might take a long time to run, use a ton of memory, and will very quickly become your major bottleneck. Despite this, there are lots of other design patterns in Go that can help solve this problem.\nCopy on Read\nWhat if we want to be able to access a state safely without doing a full copy? Instead, we can copy only the data we need for our functions. For example, say you have a function that just adds up the account balances:\nfunc TotalBalance(state *State) uint64 {\n    total := uint64(0)\n    for _, balance := range state.Balances {\n        total += balance\n    }\n    return total\n}\n\n...\n// Get a copy of the current state.\ncurrentState := s.Copy()\ntotal := TotalBalance(currentState)\nfmt.Printf(\"Total balance: %d\\n\", total)\n\nEven for such a simple computation, you still have to copy the entire state data structure! This is absolutely inefficient. You can probably get around this by not copying the state but instead just using the raw value of state.AccountBalances given you're not modifying it, you're just reading from it. However, this is dangerous! You don't want anyone to accidentally modify this value, so you want to be strict around data access and modification. A simple pattern in Go is to instead leverage unexported struct fields with getters and setters to prevent unwanted data mutation. For example, we can restructure our state to look like this:\ntype State struct {\n    accountAddresses []string\n    balances         []uint64\n}\n\nfunc (s *State) AccountAddresses() []string {\n    return DeepCopy(s.accountAddresses)\n}\n\nfunc (s *State) SetAccountAddresses(addresses []string) {\n    s.accountAddresses = DeepCopy(addresses)\n}\n\nfunc (s *State) Balances() []uint64 {\n    return DeepCopy(s.balances)\n}\n\nfunc (s *State) SetBalances(balances []uint64) {\n    s.balances = DeepCopy(balances)\n}\n\nNow, you can still pass around references to your state, but any function that uses it will only copy as much data as it needs. Instead of copying the entire state every time you just want to add up account balances, you will only copy the accounts balances list.\nfunc TotalBalance(state *State) uint64 {\n    total := uint64(0)\n    for _, balance := range state.Balances() {\n        total += balance\n    }\n    return total\n}\n\nThis pattern will prevent anyone, including yourself, from accidentally mutating a field of this state in your application outside of its defined package. This approach works for most use-cases, however, if we have a function that needs every field of the state, such as the state transition function, we are not improving at all upon the naïve case of doing a full copy every single time. Moreover, your application might do a lot more frequent data reads than writes, or vice-versa. If you're calling the TotalBalance function thousands of times per second, this pattern has a trade-off compared to no copying at all.\nCan we do better than always copying...? Let's take a look.\nCopy on Write\nAn advanced pattern for efficient memory usage while maintaining immutability guarantees is doing a copy on write approach. The general idea is that we have multiple copies of the state, but each of their inner fields point to a single, shared reference for all of them until one copy requires a mutation. A bit confusing, but let's take a look at an image to clear it up:\n\nThis means we can have multiple copies of State objects, but their inner fields, namely AccountAddresses and Balances both point to a shared reference. Each of these copies can read as much as they want from this single reference, but if they want to modify them, a copy will be created:\n\nUsing this approach, we can intelligently reuse allocations that already exist for old data and ensure we can perform really fast operations such as computing total balance or doing other computation that should not require a full copy. There are two approaches to enforcing copy on write.\n\nWe always perform a copy on write. That is, we maintain shared references by default and whenever any field is mutated, we copy it and perform a new allocation.\nWe keep track of allocated references by field. We only perform a copy on write if there exists a shared reference, otherwise we simply mutate the field as is, giving us a more advanced behavior than required.\n\nLet's take a look at how we would implement (2) in our examples, as it is a more flexible solution.\ntype fieldIndex int\n\nconst (\n    accountAddressesField fieldIndex = iota\n    balancesField\n)\n\ntype State struct {\n    sharedFieldReferences map[fieldIndex]*reference\n    accountAddresses      []string\n    balances              []uint64\n}\ntype reference struct {\n    refs uint\n}\n\nfunc (r *reference) Refs() uint {\n    return r.refs\n}\n\nfunc (r *reference) AddRef() {\n    r.refs++\n}\n\nfunc (r *reference) MinusRef() {\n    // Prevent underflow.\n    if r.refs == 0 {\n        return\n    }\n    r.refs--\n}\n\nfunc (s *State) SetBalances(balances []uint64) {\n    if s.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].Refs() == 1 { // Only this struct has a reference.\n        // Mutate in place...\n        s.balances = balances\n    } else {\n        // Decrement reference, allocate full copy, and update.\n        s.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].MinusRef()\n        s.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField] = &amp;reference{refs: 1}\n        newBalances := make([]uint64, len(balances))\n        copy(newBalances, balances)\n        s.balances = newBalances\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (s *State) SetAccountAddresses(addresses []string) {\n    if s.sharedFieldReferences[accountAddressesField].Refs() == 1 { // Only this struct has a reference.\n        // Mutate in place...\n        s.accountAddresses = addresses\n    } else {\n        // Decrement reference, allocate full copy, and update.\n        s.sharedFieldReferences[accountAddressesField].MinusRef()\n        s.sharedFieldReferences[accountAddressesField] = &amp;reference{refs: 1}\n        newAddresses := make([]string, len(addresses))\n        copy(newAddresses, addresses)\n        s.accountAddresses = newAddresses\n    }\n}\n\nNow, upon creation of a new state copy, we will be incrementing the shared field references for the new object as needed. \nfunc (s *State) Copy() *State {\n    dst := &amp;State{\n        accountAddresses:      s.accountAddresses,\n        balances:              s.balances,\n        sharedFieldReferences: make(map[fieldIndex]*reference, 2),\n    }\n\n    for field, ref := range s.sharedFieldReferences {\n        ref.AddRef()\n        dst.sharedFieldReferences[field] = ref\n    }\n\n    // Finalizer runs when the destination object is being\n    // destroyed in garbage collection.\n    runtime.SetFinalizer(dst, func(s *State) {\n    for _, v := range s.sharedFieldReferences {\n        v.MinusRef()\n    }\n    })\n    return dst\n}\n\nIn the code above, we leverage a special function from the Go standard library called runtime.SetFinalizer. From its godoc definition:\n\nSetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with obj to the provided finalizer function. When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs finalizer(obj) in a separate goroutine.\n\nThis basically tells the garbage collector what action to perform when destroying the object's allocated memory once  it is no longer needed.\nLet's try this out and prove it for ourselves with a unit test:\nfunc TestStateReferenceSharing_GarbageCollectionFinalizer(t *testing.T) {\n    // First, we initialize a state with some basic values\n    // and shared field reference counts of 1 for each field.\n    a := &amp;State{\n        accountAddresses:      make([]string, 1000),\n        balances:              make([]uint64, 1000),\n        sharedFieldReferences: make(map[fieldIndex]*reference, 2),\n    }\n    a.sharedFieldReferences[accountAddressesField] = &amp;reference{refs: 1}\n    a.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField] = &amp;reference{refs: 1}\n\n    func() {\n        // Create object in a different scope for garbage collection.\n        b := a.Copy()\n        if a.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].refs != 2 {\n            t.Error(\"Expected 2 references to balances\")\n        }\n        _ = b\n    }()\n\n    // Now, we trigger garbage collection which will call the\n    // RunFinalizer function on object b.\n    runtime.GC()\n    if a.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].refs != 1 {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected 1 shared reference to balances\")\n    }\n\n    // We initialize b again, which will cause the shared reference count\n    // for both objects to go up to 2.\n    b := a.Copy()\n    if a.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].refs != 2 {\n        t.Error(\"Expected 2 shared references to balances in a\")\n    }\n    if b.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].refs != 2 {\n        t.Error(\"Expected 2 shared references to balances in b\")\n    }\n\n    // Now, we write to b, which will cause the balances field to be copied\n    // and decrement the shared field reference for both objects.\n    b.SetBalances(make([]uint64, 2000))\n    if b.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].refs != 1 || a.sharedFieldReferences[balancesField].refs != 1 {\n        t.Error(\"Expected 1 shared reference to balances for both a and b\")\n    }\n}\n\nNow running the test...\nok      github.com/rauljordan/experiment 0.281s\n\nLet's see how much of a difference it actually makes compared to the naïve full copy approach with a benchmark:\nfunc (s *State) NaiveCopy() *State {\n    newAccountAddresses := make([]string, len(s.accountAddresses))\n    copy(newAccountAddresses, s.accountAddresses)\n    newBalances := make([]uint64, len(s.balances))\n    copy(newBalances, s.balances)\n    return &amp;State{\n        accountAddresses: newAccountAddresses,\n        balances:         newBalances,\n    }\n}\n\nfunc BenchmarkCopy_SharedReferences(b *testing.B) {\n    st1 := &amp;State{\n        accountAddresses:      make([]string, 1000),\n        balances:              make([]uint64, 1000),\n        sharedFieldReferences: make(map[fieldIndex]*reference, 2),\n    }\n    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {\n        st1.Copy()\n    }\n}\n\nfunc BenchmarkCopy_Naive(b *testing.B) {\n    st1 := &amp;State{\n        accountAddresses: make([]string, 1000),\n        balances:         make([]uint64, 1000),\n    }\n    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {\n        st1.NaiveCopy()\n    }\n}\n\nNow running the benchmark...\n$ go test -bench=. -benchmem\ngoos: darwin\ngoarch: amd64\npkg: github.com/rauljordan/experiment\nBenchmarkCopy_SharedReferences-6         3249732               451 ns/op             112 B/op          2 allocs/op\nBenchmarkCopy_Naive-6                     350588              3279 ns/op           24576 B/op          2 allocs/op\nPASS\nok      github.com/rauljordan/experiment 3.348s\n\nWow, we get almost free copies of the full state! This means we can have thousands of full state copies and all of them will be using a single shared reference for their fields. We can comfortably use them in our application having confidence that they are safe to mutate, as any mutation will create a copy and decrease the shared reference of the field. We might not have default immutability, but this is a great compromise if your application requires safe, immutable types and you perform a significant amount of reads in your application, making it super cheap to copy data for use :).\nResources\nYou may wonder, why doesn't Go just support immutability of structs and other custom types as a default feature in the language? Dave Cheney, a prominent Go developer, has an excellent post on what would happen to Go as a language if items such as generics or immutability would be added as primitives. Go is an excellent language with numerous merits albeit with some clear problems at times. Nonetheless, it is still possible to follow sound software engineering principles to be able to get around Go's weaknesses and achieve good results.\nFun fact, here is Go's list of immutable types:\n\ninterfaces\nbooleans, numeric values (including values of type int)\nstrings\npointers\nfunction pointers, and closures which can be reduced to function pointers\nstructs having a single field\n\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/immutability-patterns-in-go/","title":"Immutability Patterns in Go"},"https://rauljordan.com/key-takeaways-from-a-harvard-education/":{"body":"\nComing from Honduras, attending college in the U.S. felt an unattainable dream during my high school years. Emblazoned upon one of the entrances to Harvard University one can find the words:\n\n\"Enter to Grow in Wisdom, Depart to Serve Thy Country and Thy Kind\"\n\nThis adage, although seemingly cliché, had its words weigh heavily on me as the years went on. I promised myself when starting my first year that I would not leave its walls an unchanged man. Despite its highs and lows, here is a final list of my major takeaways from my 4 years as an undergraduate at Harvard University.\nDo something, do it passionately, and do it well\nThe first few weeks of Harvard felt like more of an extended summer camp than anything else, with hundreds of eager, giddy classmates wanting to meet each other and form friend groups early on. Everyone was on a clean slate, and despite everyone's diverse backgrounds there was one thing that always, always stuck out as a common characteristic of the group: being mission driven. Even if not obvious at first sight, everyone had some sort of particular \"drive\" that defined them. From the kids that were international chess champions, to the olympians, to the decorated oboe players. Although we all had massively different upbringings, we all came here for a reason. At least, that's what everyone tries to outwardly express throughout freshman year. \nThis drive translated well into academic performance for many, as there were seldom any instances when my peers would underperform relative to expectations. This positive or, as some may see it, negative reinforcement is one of the strongest forces at play at elite schools. Aside from the impostor syndrome that plagues every freshman, feeling that all their peers are doing something cool gives them that extra push to do something even cooler. \nSome students are remarkably humble about their achivements, showing a lot about their character and ability to downplay talents which are a major part of their identity. One of the most memorable instances of my college experience was becoming friends with someone only to find out months or years later they had globally recognized accolades they never even mentioned.  Although this extreme pressure benefits many, it has a dark side:\nUnbridled ambition has a cost\nEverything at Harvard has a next step: that next interview, that next acceptance letter, that next fellowship application...the life of a Harvard student is an endless pursuit of milestones. This eternal treadmill is paved with fear, tears, and often times, jealousy. It was common for some students to put themselves and their priorities above everyone else, even at the detriment of best friends, family and their loved ones. In times of high pressure and big stakes, such as during grad school acceptance weeks, it was not uncommon to see peers one-upping each other in unimaginable ways. Notwithstanding, this culture is how many students got there in the first place, especially those coming from competitive prep school. Of course, those frequent accomplishments slow down in the real world, as timelines become longer and more opaque. \nLittle does that culture of \"quick achievements\" prepare us for the monotony of the daily adult grind, where one finds oneself waiting 40 minutes in traffic on a Monday afternoon, where one has to take a trip to the DMV to renew a license, when one has to trug along without a clear grasp on the next rung in this ladder we call life. As a result, burn-out intensifies, and the discrepancy between this milestone culture and reality often comes at the price of students questioning their own purpose in life, often resulting in negative conclusions. I distinctly remember sitting on the steps of Widener Library my freshman year and hearing one of my close friends say:\n\n\"my whole life I prepared and worked hard for every accomplishment to get into this school, it was the end of a journey, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but no one prepared me for what I would do once I arrived\"\n\nMany of those folks that are too self-absorbed prioritize their own treadmill over the people who care about them the most. As holds true in love, friendship, and business, no one is too busy if they truly cared. Harvard, in the end, made all of us really good at identifying those people who are too deep in their own world to prioritize others.\nTo become the best, surround yourself with the best\nTwo questions that regularly float around the circles of Silicon Valley and tech culture are:\n\nHow is Harvard still around if most of its popular courses can easily be found online, or their counterparts found for free on MIT's Open Courseware?\nWhy would anyone still try to go to college in a society where endless success stories are paved by dropouts and street smarts? Is college even worth attending today?\n\nI would argue few people go to Harvard itself for its academics, but almost everyone attends due to its network effects. And when I say academics, I mean those students who truly decided on accepting their admission offer on the basis of the professors, research, and subject matter above anything else. Sure, the university itself is renowned for its research, but at the end of the day, the education it imparts is mostly a social education. \nGood or bad, Harvard is a microcosm of the elite echelons of American society, rife with superficial meritocracy, old money, unbridled ambition, and an energy unmatched by anywhere else...a place rich with nuance and juxtaposition. Although it is true that for those who seek the standard definition of \"success\" in an entrepreneurial setting can absolutely do so without attending university at all, I would argue higher education still has an important place to fill in society.\nWhen I say higher education, I don't mean $50k a year degree-mills with subpar teaching and opportunities, but rather places that aggregate diverse perspectives, provide a comprehensive social + academic education, and prepare its students to be global citizens. One thing this type of higher education provides that the \"street smarts\" of Silicon Valley lacks in structure and a clear path for many students. Colleges like Harvard provide an environment where making mistakes and exploring varied interests doesn't have to come with a catch. That is, it is place of learning for the sake of learning, both from instructors and from one's peers. For many, this is still highly beneficial and I know many peers who greatly benefit from an environment like this. At the end of the day, people go to Harvard for networking and to be surrounded by high energy folks with sky-high aspirations, and it has kept its place as prime real-estate for such folk for hundreds of years.\n\nRegardless, a vast majority of my professors were not only eminent scholars, accomplished researchers, but also absolute legends in their field. Many had theorems or inventions named after them, and had left a radical mark in the encyclopedia of human knowledge. They say if you feel you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. At Harvard, I felt like I was in the wrong universe. The amount of technical prowess, knowledge, acuity in thinking from my peers kept me on edge, and I truly felt 10x improvements in my academic + professional life by virtue of the presence of such peers. We are social animals, and we respond to social cues. Being in a place that exerts such tangible pressure by virtue of its competitiveness is something I'll never forget.\nLooking good on paper can get you pretty far, but may not be enough\nIf there's one quality that sums up every Harvard student/alum I know, it is the ability to look really good on paper. Either their resume, how they tell their story of their previous accomplishments, or how they frame their decorum of accolades when pursuing professional opportunities, it's almost impossible to not feel underaccomplished when looking at other peers.\nCantonese has an awesome phrase \"見人講人話，見鬼講鬼話\" (gin yàhn góng yàhn wáa, gin gwái góng gwái wáa) which roughly translates to \"he who deals with humans speaks like a human, he who deals with ghosts speaks like a ghost\". Its meaning says something important about knowing your audience, that is, framing your ideas/presentation/impressions based on the people you're dealing with in any situation. Although the phrase has a somewhat negative connotation of coming off as insincere or two-faced, my classmates always knew their audience, and mostly all of them had the uncanny ability to stand out regardless of their environment and people around them. Whether it be a consulting interview, a competitive application to an NGO, or a pitch to an angel investor for a startup idea, my classmates really knew how to pull the strings.\nAside from the uncanny ability of \"manipulation\" learned from Harvard, students are also very good at framing their accomplishments granduously. Many might often go over the top in how they do so, veering on the edge of arrogance. \nEither find a way to hack the system or pave your own path\nPerhaps one of the most important lessons I learned at Harvard is that rules and systems are meant to be broken. That \"scary interview\", or \"intimidating grad school application\" simply has another human being on the other side, with their whims, fears, insecurities, and quirks just like the rest of us. Systems are built by humans, and are therefore built to be hijacked, and not necessarily in malicious ways. Learning \"how to pull the strings\" is probably the first thing every student learns to perfect throughout their 4 years, and I'd wager is one of the key drivers of Harvard students' influence across the world. \nBeing scrappy eliminates ones' fear of systems with rigid rules, always finding a way to either get around those rules or game the system itself. At some point at Harvard, a student's personality is defined by how risk-averse he or she is, as that quality will define such student's social life, professional ambitions, and extra-curricular pursuits. I remember some of my classmates going through the incredibly competitive bulge bracket bank interviews junior year displaying their cunning in the most subtle ways. \nHarvard students prime themselves for the position they want to be in, whether it be a particular job or leadership position. Students reached out to key recruiters at companies such as Goldman Sachs since freshman year, or even since high school to have an edge when recruiting for internships as juniors. Those who wish to reach the top of the ladders understand these ladders are shaped by other humans, and understand what it takes to influence them or succeed in any sort of conditions, however adversarial they may be.\nWho knows you well is more important than you think\nOne of my first observations of Harvard was that, just as anywhere else, its social hierarchy was ruled by bias. Freshman year, given everyone is on a clean slate, students expend a large effort to carefully craft their new identity, often hiding their true personality with the hopes of climbing a social ladder or coming off as more impressive to peers. This façade, however, can only get one so far in any hierarchy. \nWhat matters more is who really knows you, your imperfections, and your shortcomings. There was a rare breed of student that would stay true to his/her core values throughout all 4 years, never needing to create a different public identity. These traits became even more highly valued as the years went on, and the students who would remain true to themselves and humble would become coveted friends for many. On the flip side, there are many friends that although I spent nearly 4 years with, I still can't say I truly \"know them\". Being humble really pays dividends, and those who are genuinely humble reaped rewards far more than anyone else. Being humble is important, as I learned, as it comes hand in hand with sincerity. It is a lot easier to trust someone who stays true to his/her convictions than someone who can transform his or her personality into someone unrecognizable at a moment's notice.\nReality often fails to be glamorous\nThe façade every freshman puts up when meeting other students quickly fades away. The image every student creates of themselves quickly cracks as the years pass by. The final years are the times when I, and others I am close to, felt the most vulnerable. It was times like these when me and my friends realized our time together is our most valuable asset, and there were no more hours left for superficiality. At that point, true friends come out, enemies wash away their pettiness, and everyone huddles together under a collective awareness, or dare I say fear, of what's coming next. \nUpon graduation, some may attempt to add more steps to their ladder of milestones, while the treadmill comes to an end for others. Freshman year, we're all sold these grandiose visions of our \"responsibility to do big things\", but what if \"big\" differs from student to student? Truth is, reality often fails to be as glamorous as its painted, and life plans change based on circumstance for many of us. As the years went on, it became more and more apparent that following one's identity is more important than the superficial goals society may instill upon us as students.\n\nNot every student graduates or drops out becoming the next Zuckerberg - for most, that's not matters nor what should matter. Over the years we instead developed a peculiar resilience and appreciation of each other, and despite whichever path we choose, we'll be alright. Not everyone operates on the same clock, and I've been pleasantly surprised with the path many classmates have taken compared to what they wanted to do upon first meeting them. Just because one's plans may not pan out as expected doesn't mean they are still outside the realm of possibility.\n\nThe first step to expanding your reality is to discard the tendency to exclude things from possibility\n\nE.E. Cummings, Harvard 1915\n\n\nLife is short, you're not invincible, and you're not worth more than anyone else is\nThe moment we set foot on campus until the very first day of class, we're constantly bombarded with the idea we're \"special\" - that we have a special responsibility to do \"something big\" for the world. Graduation, however, had a serious tone for me. It was a time of remembrance, of prophecy, and of echoes of times past...reminding ourselves who we are. Remiscing on our collective human experience, and the unexpected turns of life, is a far more productive exercise than the hype being sold to us as freshmen entering the college. I recently spoke to an alum who had just attended his 10 year reunion and asked him \"were you surprised at what your fellow alumni were doing professionally after 10 years?\", to which he replied \"no idea, we never talked about it...it's not important nor is it what matters\". \nHim and his friends spent the week simply reliving those special, treasured moments from their time together, the late night outings to taco joints, the shared all-nighters in Lamont library, the moments when they first met, these are the hidden gems of life that are worth living for. The years whiz by in what feels like seconds, and we all become surprised to realize it now, despite how obvious it was...ever looming in the back of our minds. The differences that once stood out when we first met were now overshowed by deep awareness of our similarities and shared experience. Our lives are not worth more than any other human being on earth, nor are we more special simply because we of where we were born or the circumstances that surrounded us growing up. Our role in this world is to do what we can leave it a better place than how we found it.\nBe careful with the example you set for others\nOne of my most vivid memories of college is sitting in the coveted course: USW 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education\" and listening to the fantastic professor Katherine Merseth stand up at the front of the classroom and tell all of us:\n\nYou think you all got here because you're wicked smart, don't ya? Well think again. You're the lucky ones...the ones who survived the cracks in our system, and you're the ones that have the biggest responsibility to fix it.\n\nOne of the reasons I truly apppreciated Prof. Kay Merseth was for her ability to not beat around the bush and tell reality like it is, really making us question the nature of our own privilege. She made us visit all sorts of schools in Boston, being extremely observant and comparing the schooling opportunities kids had across different social strata. The reality was frightening, knowing how all these kids are both filled with dreams of whom they want to become in the future, but with very different manifestations of such realities based on where they live. After the experience, I joined a program called Big Brothers, Big Sisters of Massachusetts which would match students with younger kids from disadvantages positions to be their friend, mentor, and well an \"older brother\" to a limited extent. Understanding my fortunate position and realizing the power role models can have on others was lifechanging to say the least. \nMany of these kids have fewer opportunities, and as they grow up, they are faced with constant disappointment from peers and authority figures with respect to their dreams. Having someone that can inspire you and believe in you at a core level is invaluable, and I attribute much of where I am today to role models of my youth that believed in me back then. The social responsibility the Harvard community pushes on each other is extremely beneficial, and a really great takeaway from my years there.\nThe \"real world\" is nuanced\nHidden away on the upper rafters of Memorial Church at Harvard University lies a memorial etched on the wall to honor those students who died in the midst of World War II. Each name is enumerated by school department affiliation and year, commemorated forever. Near the very end of the list, however, is a quite peculiar sight:\n\nAdolf Sannwald, Divinity School, (Enemy Casualty)\n\n\nAmidst all the students commemorated for their valiant effort in one of the darkest points of human history was the name of a very enemy they were fighting against. It is quite surreal to imagine that Sannwald and others on that list could have been walking the halls of Harvard together, eating together, learning together, and yet have been on opposite fronts with polar opposite ideologies. The decision to mark his name came with heavy controversy, marked as a critical mistake done by the administration and pushing the lines of what is considered ethical. Truth is, the name remained, and the real story of Sannwald did not materialize until years later when his wife penned a letter to the University full of comprehensive information about her deceased husband's life.\nSannwald was born to humble origins in a small town in Germany, where he grew up a studious child with great admiration for the clergy. After studying theology, he was awarded a scholarship to study at the Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1925. He became a highly respected priest, bringing the gospel to impoverished homes around his country. He actively spoke out against Nazism, uncompromising his core values. \nDespite being threated by the party of being sent to a concentration camp, he remained adamant of his position. Sannwald worked hard to raise awareness against the great injustice towards the Jewish diaspora, and understood deep down the horrible path his state was taking. At the age of 41, with 5 children, he was forced to serve on the front lines of the war, where he likely died a harrowing death.\n\nAdolf Sannwald died as a German soldier in the fighting forces of a regime he had despised and considered a calamity to his nation.\n\nHarvard equips us all to be global citizens...to understand the nuance of life. Just as Sannwald's story changed the narrative of the administration, I realized as the years go on, the line between the good and bad is a fine line, way more blurry than I initially thought. To say humans are complex is the biggest understatement, as what drives us different from where we're born, whom we're surrounded with, and what our opportunities are. \nMuch evil throughout mankind's history has been a product of alienating others by simplifying their existence to a mere category, religious denomination, or political affiliation. Our psyche is an irrational, beautiful, complex, intelligent, and emotional thing...and, at the end of the day, it is what brings us together, and it is indeed what makes us, well, human.\nAs my college years came to a close during the 2019 Harvard Commencement Address, Reverand Nieman of the Divinity School preached to us all:\n\n“The Memorial Church stands as a testament to service and sacrifice, paideia and piety, veritas and caritas,” said Walton. “We are all called to a cause greater than ourselves. … Like Adolf Sannwald — the presumed ‘enemy combatant’ — we should never assume that our service will come with accolades and awards. Trying to do the right thing may come with a price. Some may even label you an enemy combatant.\n\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/key-takeaways-from-a-harvard-education/","title":"10 Key Takeaways from a Harvard Education"},"https://rauljordan.com/my-most-embarrassing-story-as-a-beginner-software-engineer/":{"body":"The beginner's curse of not knowing when to ask \"why\"\n\n\nWe all have stories of our huge gaps in understanding we had as junior developers, and mine is so embarrassing that I used to hesitate sharing it. The beginner's journey in software is often marked by confusion, impostor syndrome, and endless tutorials that leave us no better in understanding computers than before. I was privileged enough to have studied a formal degree in computer science, and while I felt unstoppable when I first started coding 10 years ago, my hubris left a lingering sting felt to this day. \nBack in 2013, as a freshman in college, I had built a small reputation on campus for having programmed a web-app called Instanomz, a food delivery app for our campus. I became really good at following tutorials on how to build simple apps with Ruby on Rails, not even understanding how it actually worked. Yet, it was just enough knowledge to put something together that others could use, and so was Instanomz born. Armed with my go-to set of tutorials and free web UI templates, I felt I could build anything. \nA few months later, I somehow landed a side-gig helping out in building a full-stack web application. It was composed of a machine learning model for a recommendation engine written in Python, and a full-stack app with a shopping frontend written in Ruby.  Me, being decently familiar with building rails applications thanks to endless Ruby on Rails videos online, naively felt up to the task at the time.  I had just completed CS50, Harvard's popular course on computer science, and was deep into functional programming in OCaml thanks to CS51, its follow-up course. At the time, we had already learned a lot about theory, but we never learned how to build real applications. \nThe lead engineer had left the project and the team lead paid me to do the rest. My task was to get everything working by hooking up our ML model to the backend of our web app. Not knowing how naive I was, I began scouring the Internet for how a Ruby application could talk to Python code. Instead of writing a simple REST API between the two, and having the Python app as a separate server, I went off the deep end in reading about foreign-function interfaces (FFI), CPython bindings, and even crazy concepts such as releasing the Ruby VM global lock during a Python function call context. All I wanted was for my backend to call some methods from Python to receive recommendations on user-submitted data, and had developed a one-track-mind into running both as the same process. In my mind, the fact that this was so difficult felt ridiculous, and suddenly I even became convinced there was a need in the market for deep expertise in Ruby &lt;&gt; Python integrations given their popularity.\nTo add insult to injury, a few months before, maintenance stopped on the FFI Ruby gem. I felt I was fighting a losing battle. I not only spent days working on understanding opaque type-passing, C native types, callback patterns to interact between the different bindings of the Python and Ruby applications, but also had never heard of those concepts before. When I reached my limit, I posted about my problem on various forums: \"How can I call Python code from Ruby?\", and not a single person asked \"why\" I was trying to do this. In retrospect, they likely thought I was an expert exploring deep integrations between programming languages. Then again, my question did not provide any context of my problem, as one of my biggest flaws at the time was how easy I developed tunnel vision into the \"how\" and not the \"why\".\nmodule A\n  extend FFI::Library\n  ffi_lib 'c'\n  attach_function :strlen, [:string], :int\nend\nA.strlen(\"abc\")\n# 3\n\nMy project's boss, not knowing how big of a mess I had gotten myself into, soon worried about how long it was taking to integrate the two applications. He thought he could help me out, so he reached out to his sibling that was a professional software engineer at the time. His response was: \n\n\"Is it that hard to make a REST API to your Python server? Monoliths are popular these days thanks to Ruby on Rails, yes, but I'd recommend running your Python server separately and talking to it via HTTP\"\n\n...(crickets)\nMy brain turned to mush, and there was nothing else I wanted to do than to dig a hole in the ground and bury my head in it. In that span of time, I:\n\nRead almost an entire book on foreign function interfaces\nExplored endless forums on adding foreign library bindings to Ruby code\nWent down the rabbit hole of CPython's internals\nThought I was going crazy and that this was an untapped, market opportunity\nThought about starting a company that helps Ruby on Rails apps interact with other language apps\n\n...when all I had to do was send a JSON POST request to my Python app, have it do its thingamajig, and respond with its recommendation data. At the time, however, I neither took a step back and framed my question in context to others, nor did I evaluate alternatives to my problem before going deep into it. Was the fact that computer science programs do not teach practical knowledge part of the problem? I'd say yes, but it's not entirely their fault compared to my own. If there's anything to takeaway from this story, it's that knowing when to ask \"why\" was my biggest asset in growing from a naive beginner into somebody that understands computers a little bit better today.\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/my-most-embarrassing-story-as-a-beginner-software-engineer/","title":"My Most Embarrassing Story as a Beginner Software Engineer"},"https://rauljordan.com/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://rauljordan.com/pages/","title":""},"https://rauljordan.com/reuse-expensive-computation-with-in-progress-caches/":{"body":"Caching is the go-to solution in applications to avoid repeating expensive computation and instead prefer some value that can be readily fetched in-memory. A simple caching strategy is to use a cache as a thin layer above database read access as follows:\npackage main\n\nimport \"sync\"\n\ntype Database struct {\n\tcache map[string][]byte\n\tlock  sync.RWMutex\n}\n\nfunc (db *Database) GetItem(key []byte) ([]byte, error) {\n\tdb.lock.RLock()\n\tif value, ok := db.cache[string(key)]; ok {\n\t\tdb.lock.RUnlock()\n\t\treturn value\n\t}\n\tdb.lock.RUnlock()\n\treturn db.readFromDatabase(key)\n}\n\nfunc (db *Database) WriteItem(key, value []byte) error {\n\tif err := db.writeToDatabase(key, value); err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\tdb.lock.Lock()\n\tdb.cache[string(key)] = value\n\tdb.lock.Unlock()\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nThis strategy works great for applications where you have requests to read access for a certain value repeatedly, preventing you from performing a potentially expensive db query and leveraging fast access in-memory. Caching is very helpful. For some problems, however, a cache is definitely not enough.\nThe busy workers problem\nImagine you have thousands or more processes attempting to perform the same expensive computation at the same time. Perhaps all of them were notified they need to crunch certain numbers which takes a long time, or they need perform a prohibitively expensive operation that can max out your CPU or RAM if overdone. This is quite a common problem in my project, Prysm, which has many different workers in the form of goroutines often attempting to perform duplicate work. A naive solution to this is to simply leverage a cache strategy to avoid repeated computation, as shown above. However, what if there is nothing in the cache yet for the value you care about and thousands of workers are already attempting the expensive computation? Perhaps there are many workers attempting to perform an action that is already in progress. This is a great use-case for what we call an in progress cache. Let's look at an example:\npackage main\n\nimport \"sync\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\tnumWorkers := 1000\n\twg.Add(numWorkers)\n\tfor i := 0; i &lt; numWorkers; i++ {\n\t\tgo func(w *sync.WaitGroup) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\t\t\tdoSomethingExpensive()\n\t\t}(&amp;wg)\n\t}\n\twg.Wait()\n}\n\nfunc doSomethingExpensive() {\n\t// Get result from cache if it has already completed.\n\tvalue, ok := checkCache()\n\tok{\n\t\t// Do something with the cached value.\n\t}\n\n\t// Expensive operation which can take a few seconds to complete...\n}\n\nBut what if there is nothing in the cache yet when all 1000 workers are attempting to perform the expensive operation? Well, all of them will start performing your expensive operation, your computer might blow up, and our cache was pretty much useless. Instead, we can leverage the power of Go channels to mark work as in progress and instead have all workers share the same return value of whichever worker completed it first. Let's think about how to do this.\nFirst of all, we need a way to block a worker from performing expensive computation if a request we care about is already in progress. Second, once a single worker completes an expensive computation, we need to notify all workers that were attempting the same computation of the return value immediately. To accomplish the first task, we can leverage a combination of a shared map to check if a request is in progress, then subscribe to the in-progress request by initializing a channel and appending it to some shared list for the request. Finally, once a worker completes the computation, it can send out the result to all receivers subscribed to that in-progress request. Let's see it in action.\ntype service struct {\n\tinProgress         map[string]bool\n\tawaitingCompletion map[string][]chan string\n\tlock               sync.RWMutex\n}\n\nAbove, we define a simple struct used to encapsulate this information. In our example, the result of our expensive computation is some string value and the request identity is also a string. We keep track of two maps for request identities: the first is called inProgress and will be used by workers to check if expensive computation is already in progress. The second is called awaitingCompletion, which is a list of channels that are awaiting to be notified of an in-progress request. They are essentially other workers that are subscribing to the computed value of the worker currently in progress. We use a mutex to make these maps thread-safe.\nNext up, we start our main function simulating 5 workers doing some expensive operation concurrently.\nfunc main() {\n\tss := &amp;service{\n\t\tinProgress:         make(map[string]bool),\n\t\tawaitingCompletion: make(map[string][]chan string),\n\t}\n\t// Create N = 5 workers.\n\tnumWorkers := 5\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\twg.Add(numWorkers)\n\n\t// Launch N goroutines performing the same work:\n\t// a request with ID \"expensivecomputation\".\n\trequestID := \"expensivecomputation\"\n\tfor i := 0; i &lt; numWorkers; i++ {\n\t\tgo func(w *sync.WaitGroup, id string) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\t\t\tss.doWork(id)\n\t\t}(&amp;wg, requestID)\n\t}\n\n\t// Wait for all goroutines to complete work.\n\twg.Wait()\n\tfmt.Println(\"Done\")\n}\n\nNext up, we look at the key function: doWork(requestID string). We'll write it out in Go pseudocode first.\npackage main\n\nimport \"time\"\n\nfunc (s *service) doWork(requestID string) {\n\tif ok := s.inProgress[requestID]; ok {\n\t\t// Subscribe to be notified of when the in-progress\n\t\t// request completes via a channel.\n\n\t\t// Await the response from the worker currently in-progress...\n\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Mark the requestID as in progress.\n\ts.lock.Lock()\n\ts.inProgress[requestID] = true\n\ts.lock.Unlock()\n\n\t// Perform some expensive, lengthy work (time.Sleep used to simulate it).\n\ttime.Sleep(time.Second * 4)\n\tresponse := \"the answer is 42\"\n\n\t// Send to all subscribers.\n\ts.lock.RLock()\n\treceiversWaiting, ok := s.awaitingCompletion[requestID]\n\ts.lock.RUnlock()\n\tif ok {\n\t\tfor _, ch := range receiversWaiting {\n\t\t\tch &lt;- response\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Reset the in-progress data for the requestID.\n\ts.lock.Lock()\n\ts.inProgress[requestID] = false\n\ts.awaitingCompletion[requestID] = make([]chan string, 0)\n\ts.lock.Unlock()\n}\n\nWe lock around the map access to reduce lock contention in the real application. Next up, we fill in the logic for if ok := inProgress[key]; ok.\nif ok := s.inProgress[requestID]; ok {\n  // We add a buffer of 1 to prevent blocking\n  // the sender's goroutine.\n  responseChan := make(chan string, 1)\n  defer close(responseChan)\n\n  lock.Lock()\n  s.awaitingCompletion[requestID] = append(s.awaitingCompletion[requestID], responseChan)\n  lock.Unlock()\n  fmt.Println(\"Awaiting work in-progress\")\n  val := &lt;-responseChan\n  fmt.Printf(\"Work result received with value %s\\n\", val)\n  return\n}\n\nPutting it altogether, we get:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"sync\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\ntype service struct {\n\tinProgress         map[string]bool\n\tawaitingCompletion map[string][]chan string\n\tlock               sync.RWMutex\n}\n\nfunc (s *service) doWork(requestID string) {\n\ts.lock.RLock()\n\tif ok := s.inProgress[requestID]; ok {\n\t\ts.lock.RUnlock()\n\t\tresponseChan := make(chan string, 1)\n\t\tdefer close(responseChan)\n\n\t\ts.lock.Lock()\n\t\ts.awaitingCompletion[requestID] = append(s.awaitingCompletion[requestID], responseChan)\n\t\ts.lock.Unlock()\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Awaiting work completed\")\n\t\tval := &lt;-responseChan\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Work result received with value %s\\n\", val)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\ts.lock.RUnlock()\n\n\ts.lock.Lock()\n\ts.inProgress[requestID] = true\n\ts.lock.Unlock()\n\n\t// Do expensive operation\n\tfmt.Println(\"Doing expensive work...\")\n\ttime.Sleep(time.Second * 4)\n\tresult := \"the answer is 42\"\n\n\ts.lock.RLock()\n\treceiversWaiting, ok := s.awaitingCompletion[requestID]\n\ts.lock.RUnlock()\n\n\tif ok {\n\t\tfor _, ch := range receiversWaiting {\n\t\t\tch &lt;- result\n\t\t}\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Sent result to all subscribers\")\n\t}\n\n\ts.lock.Lock()\n\ts.inProgress[requestID] = false\n\ts.awaitingCompletion[requestID] = make([]chan string, 0)\n\ts.lock.Unlock()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tss := &amp;service{\n\t\tinProgress:         make(map[string]bool),\n\t\tawaitingCompletion: make(map[string][]chan string),\n\t}\n\tnumWorkers := 5\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\twg.Add(numWorkers)\n\trequestID := \"expensivecomputation\"\n\tfor i := 0; i &lt; numWorkers; i++ {\n\t\tgo func(w *sync.WaitGroup, id string) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\t\t\tss.doWork(id)\n\t\t}(&amp;wg, requestID)\n\t}\n\twg.Wait()\n\tfmt.Println(\"Done\")\n}\n\nNow running the main.go file: go run main.go, we observe it happening as expected:\nDoing expensive work...\nAwaiting work completed\nAwaiting work completed\nAwaiting work completed\nAwaiting work completed\nSent result to all subscribers\nWork result received with value the answer is 42\nWork result received with value the answer is 42\nWork result received with value the answer is 42\nWork result received with value the answer is 42\nDone\n\nOne out of 5 workers is doing the expensive work, the rest are waiting for it to complete. Once it completes after 4 seconds, the 4 subscribed workers receive the value correctly \"the answer is 42\"! Hopefully this simple approach can help you when you want to reduce duplicate work performed by your background routines, leveraging the power of Go channels to block goroutines until a value is received.\nNOTE: The code above is not meant for production, as in production you need to have better ways of dealing with goroutine context cancelation and a smarter way of namespacing requests and subscribers rather than just using naive maps.\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/reuse-expensive-computation-with-in-progress-caches/","title":"Reuse Expensive Computation With In-Progress Caches in Go"},"https://rauljordan.com/rust-concepts-i-wish-i-learned-earlier/":{"body":"\nThis past month, I have been enthralled by the Rust programming language\ngiven its unique edge for writing memory-safe, modern programs. Over the years, several languages have\nemerged as the most preferred by engineers to write resilient, backend software.

As the number 1 most loved language in\nthe famous stack overflow survey for seven years in a row, it has also recently been\nreleased as part of Linux kernel - a feat no language other than C has been able to\naccomplish.

Notwithstanding, there is a lot of\nexcellent Rust content catering to beginners and advanced\nprogrammers alike. However, so many of them focus on the explaining the core mechanics of the\nlanguage and the concept of ownership rather than architecting applications.\nAs a Go developer writing highly concurrent programs and focusing on systems programming,\nI hit a lot of bumps along the road in learning how to build real programs in Rust. That is,\nif I were to port what I am currently working on into Rust, how effective would all those\ntutorials be?\nThis blog post is meant to cover my experience going down the Rust rabbit hole and tips I wish\nsome learning resources could have taught better. Personally, I cannot learn a new language\nfrom simply watching youtube videos, but rather through seeking out solutions for myself, making mistakes,\nand feeling humbled by the process.\nOn references\nThere are two kinds of references in Rust, a shared reference (also known as a borrow), and a\nmutable reference (also known as an exclusive reference). Typically, these are seen as\n&amp;x and &amp;mut x on a variable x. The difference between these two made a lot more sense once\nI started calling the latter an “exclusive reference”.\nRust’s reference model is fairly simple. Borrowers can have as many shared reference to something as\nthey need, but there can only be a single exclusive reference at a time. Otherwise, you could have\nmany callers trying to modify a value at the same time. If many borrowers could\nalso hold exclusive references, you risk undefined behavior, which safe Rust makes impossible.\nCalling &amp;mut “exclusive” references would have saved me some time while learning Rust.\npub struct Foo {\n    x: u64,\n}\n\nimpl Foo {\n    /// Any type that borrows an instance of Foo can\n    /// call this method, as it only requires a reference to Foo.\n    pub fn total(&amp;self) -&gt; u64 {\n        self.x\n    }\n    /// Only exclusive references to instances of Foo\n    /// can call this method, as it requires Foo to be mutable.\n    pub fn increase(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.x += 1;\n    }\n}\n\nlet foo = Foo { x: 10 };\nprintln!(\"{}\", foo.total()) // WORKS.\nfoo.increase() // ERROR: Foo not declared as mut\n\nBidirectional references are possible\nIn other languages with garbage collection, it’s easy to define graph data structures or\nother types that contain references to some children, and those references could contain a reference\nto their parent. In Rust, this is hard to do without fully understanding the borrowing rules. However, it\nis still possible with methods provided by the standard library.\nLet’s say we have a struct called Node which contains a set of references to child nodes,\nand also a reference to a parent node. Normally, Rust would complain, but we can satisfy the borrow checker\nby wrapping the parent reference in something called a Weak pointer. This type tells Rust that\na node going away, or its children going away, shouldn’t mean that its parent should also be dropped.\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::{Rc, Weak};\n\nstruct Node {\n    value: i32,\n    parent: RefCell&lt;Weak&lt;Node&gt;&gt;,\n    children: RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Rc&lt;Node&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nThis gives us handy primitives in building bidirectional references. However, I soon found out that building graph\ndata structures in Rust is really hard unless you know what you’re doing, given the amount of book-keeping\none needs to do around modeling data effectively to satisfy the compiler.\nImplement Deref to make your code cleaner\nSometimes, we want to treat wrapper types as the things they contain. This is true for\ncommon data structures such as vec, smart pointers such as Box or even the reference\ncounted types such as Rc and Arc. The standard lib contains traits called Deref and\nDerefMut which will help you tell Rust how a type should be dereferenced.\nuse std::ops::{Deref, DerefMut};\n\nstruct Example&lt;T&gt; {\n    value: T\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Deref for Example&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Target = T;\n\n    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Target {\n        &amp;self.value\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; DerefMut for Example&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn deref_mut(&amp;mut self) -&gt; &amp;mut Self::Target {\n        &amp;mut self.value\n    }\n}\n\nlet mut x = Example { value: 'a' };\n*x = 'b';\nassert_eq!('b', x.value);\n\nIn the example above, we can treat *x as if it were its underlying value of “a”, and even\nmutate it because we defined rules for how it should dereference in either borrows or mutable\nreferences. This is powerful and the reason why you don’t need to worry about wrapping types\nin smart pointers such as Box. The fact that a value is boxed is an implementation detail\nwhich can be abstracted through these traits.\nstruct Foo {\n    value: u64,\n}\nlet mut foo = Box::new(Foo { value: 10 });\n\n// Box implements DerefMut, so this will work fine!\n*foo = Foo { value: 20 };\n// Dot methods will work on foo because Box implements Deref.\n// We do not have to worry about the implementation\n// detail that Foo is boxed.\nassert_eq!(20, foo.value);\n\nBe careful with methods on types that implement Deref\nEver wonder why methods such as Arc::clone exist when we could just do .clone() on\nan Arc value? The reason has to do with how types implement Deref and is something\ndevelopers should be wary of. Consider the following example, where we are trying to implement\nour own version of multi-producer/single-consumer (mpsc) channels from the standard library:\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, Condvar};\n\npub struct Sender&lt;T&gt; {\n    inner: Arc&lt;Inner&lt;T&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Sender&lt;T&gt; {\n    pub fn send(&amp;mut self, t: T) {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Clone&gt; Clone for Sender&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            // ERROR: Does not know whether to clone Arc or inner!\n            inner: self.inner.clone(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Inner&lt;T&gt; {\n    ...\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Clone&gt; Clone for Inner&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nIn the example above, we have a Sender type we want to implement the Clone trait on.\nThis struct has a field called inner which is of type Arc&lt;Inner&lt;T&gt;&gt;. Recall that Arc\nimplements Clone already and also Deref. On top of that, our Inner also implements\nClone. With the code above, Rust does not know whether we want to clone Arc or the actual\ninner value, so the code above will fail. In this case, we can use the actual method provided by Arc\nfrom the sync crate.\nimpl&lt;T: Clone&gt; Clone for Sender&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            // Now Rust knows to use the Clone method of Arc instead of the\n            // clone method of inner itself.\n            inner: Arc::clone(&amp;self.inner),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUnderstand when and when not to use interior mutability\nSometimes, you will need to use structures such as Rc or Arc in your code,\nor implement structs that wrap some data and then want to mutate the data that is\nbeing wrapped. Soon, you will hit a wall with the compiler telling you that\ninterior mutability is disallowed, which seems intractable at first sight.\nHowever, there are ways of allowing interior mutability in Rust that are even\nprovided by the standard library.\nOne of the simplest is Cell, which gives you interior mutability of data. That is,\nyou could mutate the data within an Rc as long as the data is cheap to copy. You can achieve this\nby wrapping your data within a Rc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;. It provides get and set methods, which do not even\nneed to be mut, because they copy data underneath the hood:\n// impl&lt;T: Copy&gt; Cell&lt;T&gt;\npub fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; T\n\n// impl&lt;T&gt; Cell&lt;T&gt;\npub fn set(&amp;self, val: T)\n\nOther types, such as RefCell help with moving certain borrow checks to runtime and skipping\nsome of the compiler’s tough filters. However, this is risky, as it will panic at runtime\nif borrow checks are not fulfilled. Treat the compiler as a friend and you shall be\nrewarded. By skipping its checks or by pushing them to runtime, you are telling\nthe compiler “trust me - what I am doing is sound”\nThe std::cell package even warns us about this with a helpful passage:\nThe more common inherited mutability, where one must have unique access to mutate a value, is one of the key language elements that enables Rust to reason strongly about pointer aliasing, statically preventing crash bugs. Because of that, inherited mutability is preferred, and interior mutability is something of a last resort. Since cell types enable mutation where it would otherwise be disallowed though, there are occasions when interior mutability might be appropriate, or even must be used, e.g.\n\n- Introducing mutability ‘inside’ of something immutable\n- Implementation details of logically-immutable methods.\n- Mutating implementations of Clone.\n\nGet and get mut methods are a thing\nMany types, including vec implement both get and get_mut methods, letting you borrow and mutate\nelements in the structure (the former only possible if you have a mutable reference to the collection).\nIt took me a while to know these options are available for many data structures and they helped make my life easier by \nwriting clean code a lot easier!\nlet x = &amp;mut [0, 1, 2];\n\nif let Some(elem) = x.get_mut(1) {\n    *elem = 42;\n}\nassert_eq!(x, &amp;[0, 42, 2]);\n\nEmbrace unsafe but sound code\nAs a Go developer, the “unsafe” package felt sacrilegeous and something I seldom touched. However, the notion\nof unsafety in Rust is very different. In fact, a lot of the standard library uses “unsafe” to great\nsuccess! How is this possible? Although Rust’s makes undefined behavior impossible, this does not apply to\ncode blocks that are marked as “unsafe”. Instead, a developer writing “unsafe” Rust\nsimply needs to guarantee its usage is sound to reap all the benefits.\nTake the example below, where we have a function that returns the item at a specified\nindex in an array. To optimize this lookup, there is an unsafe function in Rust called\nget_unchecked which is available on the array type. This will panic and lead to undefined behavior\nif we attempt to get an index out of bounds. However, our function correctly asserts the unsafe call\nwill only happen if the index is less than the array length. This means the code below is\nsound despite using an unsafe block.\n/// Example taken from the Rustonomicon\nfn item_at_index(idx: usize, arr: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Option&lt;u8&gt; {\n    if idx &lt; arr.len() {\n        unsafe {\n            Some(*arr.get_unchecked(idx))\n        }\n    } else {\n        None\n    }\n}\n\nEmbrace unsafe as long as you can prove the soundness of your API, but avoid exposing\nfunctions that are directly unsafe to your consumers unless it is truly warranted. For this reason,\nhaving tightly-controlled internals of your packages where you can prove unsafe blocks are sound\nis a normal practice in Rust.\nTypically, unsafe is used where performance is of absolute importance, or when you know of an easy\nway to solve a problem using unsafe blocks and you can prove the soundness of your code.\nUse impl types as arguments rather than generic constraints when you can\nComing from Golang, I thought that traits could simply be provided as function\nparameters all the time. For example:\ntrait Meower {\n    fn meow(&amp;self);\n}\n\nstruct Cat {}\n\nimpl Meower for Cat {\n    fn meow(&amp;self) {\n        println!(\"meow\");\n    }\n}\n\n// ERROR: Meower cannot be used as it does not have\n// a size at compile time!\nfn do_the_meow(meower: Meower) {\n    meower.meow();\n}\n\n…but the above fails, as trait objects do not have a size at compile time which\nRust needs in order to get the job done. We could get around it by adding &amp;dyn Meower\nand telling the compiler this is dynamically sized, but I soon learned this is not the “rusty”\nsolution. Instead, developers tend to pass in generic parameters constrained by a trait. For example:\nfn do_the_meow&lt;M: Meower&gt;(meower: M) {\n    meower.meow();\n}\n\n…which compiles and passes. However, as functions get more complex, we might have a very hard-to-read\nfunction signature if we also include other generic parameters. In this example, we don’t really\nneed a generic type if all we want is to meow once. We don’t even care about the results of the meow, so we\ncan instead rewrite as\nfn do_the_meow(meower: &amp;impl Meower) {\n    meower.meow();\n}\n\nwhich tells the compiler “I just want something that implements Meow”. This pattern is a lot cleaner\nwhen this is all you need, and there is no need for a generic return type of your function in the first place.\niter() when you need to borrow, iter mut() for exclusive refs, and into iter() when you need to own\nMany tutorials immediately jump to iterating over vectors using the into_iter method below:\nlet items = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nfor item in items.into_iter() {\n    println!(\"{}\", item);\n}\n\nHowever, many beginners (myself included) hit a wall when we start using this iterator method\nwithin structs, such as:\nstruct Foo {\n    bar: Vec&lt;u32&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn all_zeros(&amp;self) -&gt; bool {\n        // ERROR: Cannot move out of self.bar!\n        self.bar.into_iter().all(|x| x == 0)\n    }\n}\n\nand immediately hit:\n    error[E0507]: cannot move out of `self.bar` which is behind a shared reference\n       --&gt; src/main.rs:9:9\n        |\n    9   |         self.bar.into_iter().all(|x| x == 0)\n        |         ^^^^^^^^ ----------- `self.bar` moved due to this method call\n        |         |\n        |         move occurs because `self.bar` has\n        |         type `Vec&lt;u32&gt;`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n\nAfter trying all kinds of approaches as a noob, I realized that .into_iter() takes ownership\nof the collection, which is not what I needed for my purposes. Instead, there are two other useful methods\non iterators that I wish I had learned about earlier. The first is .iter(), which borrows the\ncollection, letting you assert things about its values but not own or mutate them, and also .iter_mut()\nwhich helps you mutate internal values of the collection as long as you have the only exclusive reference.\nIn summary, use .iter() when you just need to borrow, .into_iter() when you want\ntake ownership, and .iter_mut() when you need to mutate elements of an iterator.\nPhantom data is more than just for working with raw pointers to types\nPhantom data seems weird when you first encounter it, but it soon makes sense as a way\nof telling the compiler one “owns” a certain value despite just having a raw pointer to it.\nFor example:\nuse std::marker;\n\nstruct Foo&lt;'a, T: 'a&gt; {\n    bar: *const T,\n    _marker: marker::PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a T&gt;,\n}\n\nTells the compiler that Foo owns T, despite only having a raw pointer to it. This is helpful\nfor applications that need to deal with raw pointers and use unsafe Rust. \nHowever, they can also be a way\nto tell the compiler that your type does not implement the Send or Sync traits! You can\nwrap the following types with PhantomData and use them in your structs as a way to tell the compiler\nthat your struct is neither Send nor Sync.\npub type PhantomUnsync = PhantomData&lt;Cell&lt;()&gt;&gt;;\npub type PhantomUnsend = PhantomData&lt;MutexGuard&lt;'static, ()&gt;&gt;;\n\nUse rayon for incremental parallelism\nSometimes, you want to parallelize work when iterating through collections, but hit a brick wall\nwhen dealing with threading and making types safe to send across threads. Sometimes, the\nextra boilerplate just isn’t worth it if it makes your code almost unreadable.\nInstead, there is an awesome package called Rayon\nwhich provides fantastic tools for parallelizing your computations in a seamless manner. For example,\nlet’s say we have a function that computes the sum of squares of an array.\nfn sum_of_squares(input: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; i32 {\n    input.iter()\n            .map(|i| i * i)\n            .sum()\n}\n\nThe above can absolutely be parallelized due to the nature of multiplication and addition, and Rayon\nmakes it trivial to do so by giving us automatic access to “parallel iterators” on collections such\nas arrays. Here’s what it looks like with pretty much zero boilerplate. It also does not compromise\nreadability at all.\n// Importing rayon prelude is what gives us access to .par_iter on arrays.\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn sum_of_squares(input: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; i32 {\n    // We can use par_iter on our array to let rayon\n    // handle the parallelization and reconciliation of\n    // results at the end.\n    input.par_iter()\n            .map(|i| i * i)\n            .sum()\n}\n\nUnderstand the concept of extension traits when developing Rust libraries\nSo how does Rayon accomplish the above in such a clean way? The answer lies in “extension traits”,\nwhich are traits that can be defined as extensions to other traits, such as Iterator. That is,\nwe can add other helpful functions to items that normally implement the Iterator trait,\nbut they will only be available if the trait is in scope, such as by importing it in a file.\nThis approach is excellent because these traits will only be available if you import the extension\ntrait in your project, and provide a great way to extend common collections and types with clean APIs\nthat developers can use just as easily as their normal counterparts. Using parallel iterators\nis as easy as using iterators in Rust thanks to Rayon’s extension traits.\nIn fact, there is a highly informative talk that explains how to use extension traits\nto develop a library that provides progress bars on iterators here\nEmbrace the monadic nature of Option and Result types\nAfter working with options and results, one will quickly see that `.unwrap()` moves\nvalues out of them, which will fail if the option or result is part of a shared reference\nsuch as a struct. However, sometimes all we want is to assert the option matches a value within\nor to obtain a reference to its internals. There are many ways to do this, but one way\nis to never leave the domain of options at all.\nfn check_five(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; bool {\n    // Contains can just check if the Option has what we want.\n    x.contains(&amp;5)\n}\n\nAnother example is one where we want to replace data inside of an option\nwith the None value, perhaps when interacting with some struct. We could write this\nin an imperative programming manner, and do things verbosely as follows:\nstruct Foo {\n    data: Option&lt;T&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt; {\n    // Takes the value of data and leaves None in its place.\n    fn pop(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {\n        if self.data.is_none() {\n            return None;\n        }\n        let value = self.data.unwrap();\n        self.data = None;\n        value\n    }\n}\n\nHowever, Options have some really cool properties due to their fundamental nature\nthat they have useful methods defined on them which can make our lives a lot easier.\n// Takes the value of data and leaves None in its place.\nfn pop(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {\n    self.data.take()\n}\n\nOptions in Rust are modeled after the same paradigm in functional programming languages, belonging\nto a broader category of data types known as Monads. We won’t into what those are, but just think\nof them as wrappers around data that we can manipulate without needing to take things out of them. For example,\npicture a function which adds the inner values of two options together and returns an option.\nfn add(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;, y: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {\n    if x.is_none() || y.is_none() {\n        return None;\n    }\n    return Some(x.unwrap() + y.unwrap());\n}\n\nThe above looks kind of clunky because of the none checks it needs to perform, and it also\nsucks that we have to extract values out of both options and construct a new option out of that.\nHowever, we can much better than this thanks to Option’s special properties! Here’s what we could do\nfn add(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;, y: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {\n    x.zip(y).map(|(a, b)| a+b)\n}\n\nWe can zip and map options just like we can over arrays and vectors. This property is also found in\nResult types, and even in things such as `Future` types. If you’re curious about why this works,\nlearn more about Monads here.\nEmbrace the monadic nature of the Option and Result types and don’t just use\nunwrap and if x.is_none() {} else everywhere. They have so many useful methods defined which you can read about in\nthe standard library.\nUnderstand Drop how it should be implemented for different data structures\nThe standard library describes the Drop trait as:\nWhen a value is no longer needed, Rust will run a “destructor” on that value. The most common way that a\nvalue is no longer needed is when it goes out of scope.\npub trait Drop {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self);\n}\n\nDrop is critical when writing data structures in Rust. One must have a sound approach towards how memory\nwill be thrown away once you no longer need it. Using reference-counted types can help you get over\nthese hurdles but it will not always be enough. For example, writing a custom linked list, or writing\nstructs that use channels, would typically need to implement a custom version of Drop. Implementing drop is actually\nfar easier than it seems, when you see how the standard lib actually does it:\n// That's it!\nfn drop&lt;T&gt;(t: T) {}\n\nUsing the clever rules of destruction upon losing scope, std::mem::drop has an empty function body! This is a\ntrick you can use in your own custom Drop implementations as long as you cover all of your bases.\nReally annoyed by the borrow checker? Use immutable data structures\nFunctional programmers love to say that global, mutable state is the root\nof all evil, so why use it if you can avoid it? Thanks to Rust’s functional constructs,\nwe are able to construct data structures that never need mutation the first place! This is especially\nhelpful when you need to write pure code similar to that seen in Haskell, OCaml, or other\nlanguages.\nWith an example taken from a comprehensive tutorial on linked lists, we see how one could build an immutable list where nodes are reference counted:\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\npub struct List&lt;T&gt; {\n    head: Link&lt;T&gt;,\n}\n\ntype Link&lt;T&gt; = Option&lt;Rc&lt;Node&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;;\n\nstruct Node&lt;T&gt; {\n    elem: T,\n    next: Link&lt;T&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        List { head: None }\n    }\n\n    pub fn prepend(&amp;self, elem: T) -&gt; List&lt;T&gt; {\n        List { head: Some(Rc::new(Node {\n            elem: elem,\n            next: self.head.clone(),\n        }))}\n    }\n\n    pub fn tail(&amp;self) -&gt; List&lt;T&gt; {\n        List { head: self.head.as_ref().and_then(|node| node.next.clone()) }\n    }\n    ...\n\nThis is awesome because it acts similarly to functional data structures where one does not\nmodify a list by prepending, but rather creates a list by constructing with the new element\nas its head and the existing list as the tail.\n    [head] ++ tail\n\nNote that none of the methods above need to be mut because our data structure is immutable! This is also\nefficient on memory because the structure is reference counted, meaning we won’t be wasting\nunnecessary resources duplicating the underlying memory of nodes if there are multiple callers on this\ndata structure.\nPure, functional code in Rust is neat, but many times, one will need tail recursion to write\ncode that is performant in this manner. However, be careful, as tail-call optimization is not guaranteed\nby the Rust compiler. See more on this here\nBlanket traits help reduce duplication\nSometimes, you might want to constrain a generic parameter by many different traits:\nstruct Foo&lt;T: Copy + Clone + Ord + Bar + Baz + Nyan&gt; {\n    vals: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n}\n\nHowever, this can quickly get out of hand as soon as you start writing impl\nstatements, or when having multiple generic params. Instead, you can define a blanket\ntrait that can make your code a more DRY.\ntrait Fooer: Copy + Clone + Ord + Bar + Baz + Nyan {}\n\nstruct Foo&lt;F: Fooer&gt; {\n    vals: Vec&lt;F&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;F: Fooer&gt; Foo&lt;F&gt; { ... }\n\nBlanket traits can help reduce duplication, however, don’t let them get way too big. In many cases,\nhaving a type require so many constraints might be a code-smell, as you are creating too large of\nan abstraction. Instead, pass in concrete types if you notice your constraints get too large for no reason.\nCertain applications, however, might benefit from blanket traits, such as libraries that aim\nto provide as generic of an API as possible.\nMatch statements are very flexible and structural in nature\nInstead of nesting match statements, for example, one could bring values together as tuples and do\nthe following:\nfn player_outcome(player: &amp;Move, opp: &amp;Move) -&gt; Outcome {\n    use Move::*;\n    use Outcome::*;\n    match (player, opp) {\n        // Rock moves.\n        (Rock, Rock) =&gt; Draw,\n        (Rock, Paper) =&gt; Lose,\n        (Rock, Scissors) =&gt; Win,\n        // Paper moves.\n        (Paper, Rock) =&gt; Win,\n        (Paper, Paper) =&gt; Draw,\n        (Paper, Scissors) =&gt; Lose,\n        // Scissor moves.\n        (Scissors, Rock) =&gt; Lose,\n        (Scissors, Paper) =&gt; Win,\n        (Scissors, Scissors) =&gt; Draw,\n    }\n}\n\nThis is an example of why pattern matching is far more powerful than switch statements seen in imperative\nlanguages and it can do more much than that when it comes to deconstructing inner values!\nAvoid _ =&gt; clauses in match statements if your matchees are finite and known\nFor example, let’s say we have an enum:\nenum Foo {\n    Bar,\n    Baz,\n    Nyan,\n    Zab,\n    Azb,\n    Bza,\n}\n\nWhen writing match statements, we should match every single type of the enum if we can and not\nresort to catch-all clauses\nmatch f {\n    Bar =&gt; { ... },\n    Baz =&gt; { ... },\n    Nyan =&gt; { ... },\n    Zab =&gt; { ... },\n    Azb =&gt; { ... },\n    Bza =&gt; { ... },\n}\n\nThis is really helpful for maintenance of code, because if the original writer of the enum adds\nmore variants to it, the project won’t compile if we forget to handle the new variants in our match statements.\nMatch guard clauses are powerful\nMatch guards are awesome when you have an unknown or potentially infinite number of matchees, such as\nranges of numbers. However, they will force you to have a catch-all `_ =&gt;` if your range cannot be fully encompassed\nby the guard, which can be a downside when writing maintainable code.\nThe canonical example from the Rust book is below:\nenum Temperature {\n    Celsius(i32),\n    Fahrenheit(i32),\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let temperature = Temperature::Celsius(35);\n    match temperature {\n        Temperature::Celsius(t) if t &gt; 30 =&gt; println!(\"{}C is above 30 Celsius\", t),\n        Temperature::Celsius(t) =&gt; println!(\"{}C is below 30 Celsius\", t),\n        Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) if t &gt; 86 =&gt; println!(\"{}F is above 86 Fahrenheit\", t),\n        Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) =&gt; println!(\"{}F is below 86 Fahrenheit\", t),\n    }\n}\n\nNeed to mess with raw asm? There’s a macro for that!\nCore asm provides a macro that lets you write inline assembly in Rust, which can help when doing fancy\nthings such as directly intercepting the CPU’s stack, or wanting to implement advanced optimizations.\nHere’s an example where we use inline assembly to trick the processor’s stack to execute our\nfunction by simply moving the stack pointer to it!\nuse core::arch::asm;\n\nconst MAX_DEPTH: isize = 48;\nconst STACK_SIZE: usize = 1024 * 1024 * 2;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Default)]\n#[repr(C)]\nstruct StackContext {\n    rsp: u64,\n}\n\nfn nyan() -&gt; ! {\n    println!(\"nyan nyan nyan\");\n    loop {}\n}\n\npub fn move_to_nyan() {\n    let mut ctx = StackContext::default();\n    let mut stack = vec![0u8; MAX as usize];\n    unsafe {\n        let stack_bottom = stack.as_mut_ptr().offset(MAX_DEPTH);\n        let aligned = (stack_bottom as usize &amp; !15) as *mut u8;\n        std::ptr::write(aligned.offset(-16) as *mut u64, nyan as u64);\n        ctx.rsp = aligned.offset(-16) as u64;\n        switch_stack_to_fn(&amp;mut ctx);\n    }\n}\n\nunsafe fn switch_stack_to_fn(new: *const StackContext) {\n    asm!(\n        \"mov rsp, [{0} + 0x00]\",\n        \"ret\",\n        in(reg) new,\n    )\n}\n\nUse Criterion to benchmark your code and its throughput\nThe Criterion package for benchmarking Rust code is a fantastic work of engineering. It gives you access to awesome benchmarking features with graphs,\nregression analysis, and other fancy tools. It can even be used to measure different dimensions of your\nfunctions such as time and throughput. For example, we can see how fast we can construct, take, and collect\nraw bytes using the standard library’s iterator methods at different histogram buckets.\nuse std::iter;\n\nuse criterion::BenchmarkId;\nuse criterion::Criterion;\nuse criterion::Throughput;\nuse criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main};\n\nfn from_elem(c: &amp;mut Criterion) {\n    static KB: usize = 1024;\n\n    let mut group = c.benchmark_group(\"from_elem\");\n    for size in [KB, 2 * KB, 4 * KB, 8 * KB, 16 * KB].iter() {\n        group.throughput(Throughput::Bytes(*size as u64));\n        group.bench_with_input(BenchmarkId::from_parameter(size), size, |b, &amp;size| {\n            b.iter(|| iter::repeat(0u8).take(size).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;());\n        });\n    }\n    group.finish();\n}\n\ncriterion_group!(benches, from_elem);\ncriterion_main!(benches);\n\nand after adding the following entries to the project’s Cargo.toml file, one can run it with `cargo bench`.\n[dev-dependencies]\ncriterion = \"0.3\"\n\n[[bench]]\nname = \"BENCH_NAME\"\nharness = false\n\nNot only does criterion show you really awesome charts and descriptive info, but it\ncan also remember prior results of benchmark runs, telling you of performance regressions.\nIn this case, I was using my computer to do a lot of other things at the same time as I ran the benchmark, so it\nnaturally regressed from the last time I measured it.

When writing abstractions in Go, interfaces are some of the most powerful tools available to developers, providing a whole suite of useful functionality for your applications and expressive packages.\n\nOne underappreciated pattern of using interfaces in Go is the ability to compose them to build up more complex abstractions. Interface composition allows developers to create small building blocks which only expose necessary methods. This pattern is a powerful way of restricting access to dangerous methods and helping to protect developers from biting their own tongue.\nBrief detour into interface composition\nSkip ahead if you are already familiar with interface composition\nInterfaces are built-in types meant to define behavior of a potential set of types, such as structs. How that behavior is implemented is up to the specific struct that meets the requirements of the interface. The great thing about interfaces in Go is they are composable. This means you can build up pretty sophisticated interfaces using basic building blocks. For example, let's say we want to define some interface for a File type.\ntype File interface {\n  Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n  Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n  Close() error\n  Name() string\n}\n\nReading and writing bytes somewhere is such a common occurence in Go programs that the standard library provides very minimal, yet powerful interfaces to meet these exact needs. Namely: io.Reader and io.Writer.\ntype Reader interface {\n  Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n}\n\ntype Writer interface {\n  Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n}\n\nSometimes, objects that read also like to write, so we can combine them as follows and reduce the amount of code we have to duplicate:\ntype ReadWriter interface {\n  Reader\n  Writer\n}\n\nThere's even a ReadWriteCloser interface that composes the primitive io.Closer type as well. We can rewrite our file interface by composing basic interfaces as follows:\nimport \"io\"\n\ntype File interface {\n  io.ReadWriteCloser\n  Name() string\n}\n\nBecause a file is an io.ReadWriteCloser, it can be used by _any Go functions that accept that interface as an argument. This makes it trivial to write tests, integrate into third-party packages, and provides what is close enough to a standard for Go projects, especially using the built-in io package for code reuse. Interface composition is a powerful tool, especially when working with small interfaces you can combine into more expressive abstractions.\nComposition of this flavor is quite different from traditional, object-oriented inheritance. Because our file interface is an io.ReadWriteCloser, it is also a io.Closer, an io.Reader, and io.Writer, so there is no shortage of useful places it can be used and immediately integrated with. This is the power of composition over traditional inheritance in other programming languages. Other examples of popular types that implement the io.Reader interface are HTTP requests, websocket connections, streams, and more.\nReal-life use case: code guardrails using incremental interface composition\nAt my company, we maintain an open source implementation of an Ethereum consensus node called Prysm. The current Ethereum proof of stake chain secures many billions of dollars, and a large percentage of nodes in the network choose to run our software, meaning we must have the highest quality guarantees and a low margin-of-error.\nOne particular problem that hurt us several times over the years was allowing unrestricted database access. For example, we had a single Database interface that would be define getters and setters for the data we care about at runtime.\ntype Database interface {\n  SaveBlock(block *pb.BeaconBlock) error\n  BlockByRoot(root [32]byte) (*pb.BeaconBlock, error)\n  SaveState(state *pb.BeaconState, blockRoot [32]byte) error\n  StateByRoot(blockRoot [32]byte) (*pb.BeaconState, error)\n  ... // A few other critical methods.\n}\n\nThe problem in a large codebase is, although we trust all our teammates to not misuse code, having public APIs such as this interface can be extremely risky. We would pass in this Database interface to all services that wanted it, and anyone could call dangerous access methods such as SaveBlock. Even accessing methods such as StateByRoot excessively would lead to bottlenecks at runtime in memory use. In fact, one consensus failure we had in a local test network was due to us saving states in multiple places, leading to catastrophe.\nIncremental access restrictions: use only what you need\nEven though you may trust yourself to use your own code responsibly, new developers and contributors will join your project and will assume any public method is free to use if it helps them solve a real problem. Instead of informally enforcing some arbitrary rules on teammates, we redesigned how we use our Database interface for greater safety. We noticed the vast majority of cases only needed read-access to certain data types. On top of that, it was rare that we needed state read-access as well. We used interface composition to restructure our code below:\ntype NoStateAccessReadOnlyDB interface {\n  BlockByRoot(root [32]byte) (*pb.BeaconBlock, error)\n}\n\ntype ReadOnlyDB interface {\n  NoStateAccessReadOnlyDB\n  StateByRoot(blockRoot [32]byte) (*pb.BeaconState, error)\n}\n\ntype ReadWriteDB interface {\n  ReadOnlyDB  \n  SaveState(state *pb.BeaconState, blockRoot [32]byte) error\n  StateByRoot(blockRoot [32]byte) (*pb.BeaconState, error)\n}\n\nThis is powerful, because then we only pass in what we need to the services that require database access.

This post showcases how we went down a rabbit hole of information only to conclude a resolution was far easier than we thought.\nSummary\n\nAn extremely elusive bug in our production application running on pointed to some behavior that was impossible to reproduce locally\nWe went deep into the rabbit hole of thinking the problem had to do with how syscalls are used by our database\nWe had proof our code was not inefficient with benchmarks the entire team ran, but yet the numbers in production were showing us the application was indeed, inefficient\nMy teammate, Preston Van Loon, ended up coming up with a solution to the problem via a simple, software engineering design\n\n\nKey takeaway: software benchmarks are not absolute truths\n\nAt my company, we maintain a software implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain called Prysm. At the time of writing, Ethereum 2.0 is a live, proof-of-stake network with over $5 billion USD at stake, with our software powering over half of the network.\nIn order to release software updates, our code goes through an intensive series of testing pipelines, even running in a public staging environment called the Pyrmont testnet before we are confident enough to tag a release that is compatible with the real network. As such, we run a complex Kubernetes deployment where we run our software replicas, canary deployments, and more as a distributed system. Any serious bug that makes it into production could causes losses in the many millions of dollars to a collective group of people using our software around the world. As such, we take releases very seriously.\nOur application is very read-intensive, which is why we opted to use BoltDB, a popular, embedded key-value store as our database of choice. Bolt uses an underlying data structure known as a B+ tree which is great for our high amount of read/write ratio in db operations.\nOver the past few weeks, we noticed something quite strange when we were doing our regular tests in our cloud cluster. We started noticing that database calls were extremely poor upon startup, leading to significant errors at runtime and performance nearly grinding to a halt for the first 10-30 minutes of operation, before going back to being fully operational. This behavior was deterministic on every single restart of the application, and it soon became a critical issue we had to investigate.\n\nIt must be something in Kubernetes, right?\nWe realized that no matter how many times we would try to reproduce this locally via benchmarks or small, testruns that our Kubernetes cluster would always run into this crazy issue. We were convinced that perhaps google cloud platform is giving our Kubernetes nodes really bad persistent storage, or that the actual machines such as I/O, but that was far from the case.\n\nIn fact, we were barely even using the IOPS limits of the machines we had allocated in our cluster.\nIt must be something about how our application interacts with the operating system's memory via syscalls, right?\nEmbedded key-value stores such as BoltDB are so powerful because they contain all the data you want, persisted in a single file. These databases use an operating system call named mmap which is able to map the contents of a file, even very large ones, to your computer's memory directly, allowing for lightning-fast random access to its data. Popular file-based databases such as bolt and sqlite use mmap extensively.\nMmap as a system call is a very powerful tool. MMap is arguably the reason why embedded key-value stores can be so darn performant, even in programming languages that may not be the known for speed. The problem with mmap is that of course, you need to know how much to initially allocate, and dynamically grow that allocation to fit your software's needs. We realized that bolt db's mmap defaults were actually too conservative.\n\nSeems like mmap grows very slowly if the initial size is not specified, growing by only 32Kb increments.\nwe immediately thought, aha! So our application probably spends way too much time in the beginning initializing mmap and growing by small chunks until it reaches the required allocation, and then goes back to normal. The story fits the pattern we have been seeing for so long, it must be it. So then, we created our own fork of the bolt DB dependency in our application, added specific prometheus metrics around mmap usage, the number of reallocations, and the final allocated size at equilibrium.\n\nWe tried to increase the initial mmap size of the database, but nothing happened, the charts remained the same.\nOkay, it must be something weird about BoltDB, probably some other bug, right?\nOur team ended up creating its own fork of our database dependency, BoltDB, and adding in our own metrics into the mix. We wanted to have as much observability as possible over everything happening in our database interactions.\n\nEverything.\nWe started digging around for patterns, and something really stood out which made sense with the problems we were observing. Namely, we noticed that the rate of how long write transactions were taking would skyrocket when our application starts:\n\nNear the top, it slows down dramatically to a linear rate, but has a high rate of growth at its very beginning. We tried to correlate this with the ratio of read/write transactions, the number of open read transactions at any given time, and more. However, this was just a symptom of a greater problem at hand.\nWe even tried investigating mutex lock/unlock operations in the BoltDB code itself, realizing that this was really not a problem, since the time spent waiting for transactions to unlock their mutex would be extremely low.\n\nIn fact, when looking at the charts, it seemed the actual logic of reading and writing was taking way too long, a fact that points towards our code being the problem.\nBack to square one\nAt the end of this entire session we decided to take a simple CPU profile using pprof and looked at the flame graph. \n\nAha, it's clear that iterating over all keys in a particular db bucket is taking up a big portion of the flames, but is it really that bad? Can bolt really not handle iterating over a bucket this way?\nWe began tweaking parameters, modifying things such as bucket-level and transaction-level optimizations, but we felt like we were still shooting in the dark here. That's when we went back to the basics and looked at the assumptions of our algorithm.\nWhen \"best-case\" time complexity really matters\nIn summary, the algorithm we were performing roughly goes as follows (in pseudocode):\ninput = (x uint64, y uint64)\nfor key, value in bucket:\n  surrounding = x &lt; key and y &gt; value\n  surrounded = x &gt; key and y &lt; value\n  if surrounding or surrounded:\n    return NOT_OK\nreturn OK\n\nDuring normal conditions, there should never be a NOT_OK returned from this algorithm. This means that even in the best-case scenario, the algorithm above will loop through all the buckets. Time complexity is O(n) and Ω(n), not great at all. \nYou might think this is terrible engineering and a lack of foresight, however, the reason we went with this relatively naive approach in the first place was because there is a known upper bound to n of 54000. We were able to prove, with a benchmark, that 2000 concurrent runs of this algorithm at that upper bound take a total of 300ms to complete, which is within reason, and with minimal resource footprint. We also didn't anticipate reaching that upper bound anytime soon. So why, then, were we having problems? Was our benchmark flawed? Were we missing something?\nWhen it comes to benchmarking, it can be almost impossible to capture all latent variables of how your code will run in production. Our benchmark showed none of the difficulties we would see in our actual Kubernetes cluster, especially because it was run in isolation and not fully representative of the rest of the runtime which has significant contention with the database, could run into unexpected behavior that is hard to deterministically capture, and was also, of course, running on weaker VMs. In most cases, benchmarks are directionally representative of how you can expect your code to perform. However, creating an intricate representation of the details of database access in an isolated benchmark is non-trivial and error-prone. As such, we were clearly missing something. We even made a simulator here that tries to emulate our runtime as much as possible, but it fell short as it is impossible to capture all latent variables.\nWe decided to go back to principles of software design. My teammate, Preston Van Loon asked the question: \"what if we just change our database schema?\". First of all, we have a precondition that the keys in the database bucket are monotonically increasing unsigned integers, that is, they are ordered from 0 to worst-case, 54000. Moreover, each key value pair is cheap to store, only 16 bytes total. If we notice above in our pseudocode, we have two conditions we care about:\nsurrounding = x &lt; key and y &gt; value\nsurrounded = x &gt; key and y &lt; value\n\nInstead of iterating over all keys in the bucket, let's handle each of these conditions separately.\nFor surrounding:\ninput = (x uint64, y uint64)\nfor key, value in bucket:\n  if x &lt; key and y &gt; value:\n    return NOT_OK\n\nNotice that we can actually exit early here if we find a key that is less than or equal to x. Why? Since the keys are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing and ordered, if we ever find a key &lt;= x, it if impossible we'll ever meet the conditional. Since this bucket in the database only grows via appending to it greater values than before, we can actually iterate over this bucket in reverse. So we can rewrite as:\ninput = (x uint64, y uint64)\nfor (key, value) = bucket.last() to bucket.first():\n  if key &lt;= x:\n    return OK # Exit early!\n  if x &lt; key and y &gt; value:\n    return NOT_OK\n\nIn ideal conditions, we will exit early very quickly in this loop, giving us a \"best-case\" performance of Ω(1), which is amazing! but how can we perform our other check, for surrounded? Well, we can actually duplicate the same bucket, but in reverse. Instead of key=&gt;value, we store value=&gt;key, and perform the same check. Mathematically, it allows us to achieve the same results. Since data storage is cheap but performance is non-negotiable, this approach seemed like the optimal trade-off we had been looking for since the beginning.\nWe were itching to try it. We built new docker images, pushed them out to our cluster, and boom:\n\nStable, linear growth rate for transaction write seconds in our database, exactly what we wanted to see. Success! At the end, it looks like our application was backlogged in terms of transactions upon startup, taking so long to recover and go back to being fully operational due to our inefficient code.\nIt had been a crazy week starting with staring at charts of mmap usage, looking deep into the internals of boltDB, banging our head against the wall with all sorts of explanations of what could go wrong, and at the end of the day all it took was some old-fashioned software engineering and critical thinking.\nWhen you are neck deep into a problem, thinking the solution lies deep in some freak behavior of your operating system, maybe it's time to take a step back and just look at the code you wrote. \nThe key takeaway of this post is that never take a benchmark as absolute truth. We were so hung up on the idea that our benchmark was law and that there is no way the code is actually inefficient at runtime. The truth, was far more nuanced.\nReferences\n\nBoltDB Read/Write Concurrency\nHow Databases Use Mmap\nBoltDB source code analysis (Chinese)\n\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/when-a-solution-is-right-in-front-of-your-eyes/","title":"When a Solution Is Right In Front of You"},"https://rauljordan.com/when-years-of-work-materialize/":{"body":"Back in late 2017, I was curious about a particular technology called Ethereum when I understood its incredible potential to change the world. I assembled a team of software engineers I met on the Internet that shared this vision and for 4 years, we have worked tirelessly to upgrade the system to one that is more economically and environmentally sustainable. \n\nOn Thursday, September 15th 2022, we shipped the biggest upgrade in its history. Ethereum is now a system that no longer requires damanging the environment via cryptocurrency mining. For years, many thought this to be so complex that we would never pull it off.

Moving forward, proof-of-stake paves the way for some really interesting innovation on the Ethereum blockchain, which plans to become the most scalable, decentralized, and secure smart contract chain in the world.

If you look into any project on Github written in Go, it's almost a guarantee you'll see the lines more frequently than anything else in the codebase:\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\n\nAlthough it may seem redundant and unnecessary for those new to the language, the reason errors in Go are treated as first-class citizens (values) has a deeply-rooted history in programming language theory and the main goal of Go as a language itself. Numerous efforts have been made to change or improve how Go deals with errors, but so far, one proposal is winning above all others:\nLeave if err != nil alone!\nGo's error philosophy\nGo's philosophy regarding error handling forces developers to incorporate errors as first class citizens of most functions they write. Even if you ignore an error using something like:\nfunc getUserFromDB() (*User, error) { ... }\n\nfunc main() {\n    user, _ := getUserFromDB()\n}\n\nMost linters or IDEs will catch that you're ignoring an error, and it will certaintly be visible to your teammates during code review. However, in other languages, it may not be clear that your code is not handling a potential exception in a try catch code block, being completely opaque about handling your control flow.\nIf you handle errors in Go the standard way, you get the benefits of:\n\nNo hidden control-flows\nNo unexpected uncaught exception logs blowing up your terminal (aside from actual program crashes via panics)\nfull-control of errors in your code as values you can handle, return, and do anything you want with\n\nNot only is the syntax of func f() (value, error) easy to teach to a newcomer, but also a standard in any Go project which ensures consistency. \nIt's important to note Go's error syntax does not force you to handle every error your program may throw. Go simply provides a pattern to ensure you think of errors as critical to your program flow, but not much else. At the end of your program, if an error occurs, and you find it using err != nil, and your application doesn't do something actionable about it, you're in trouble either way - Go can't save you. Let's take a look at an example:\nif err := criticalDatabaseOperation(); err != nil {\n    // Only logging the error without returning it to stop control flow (bad!)\n    log.Printf(\"Something went wrong in the DB: %v\", err)\n    // WE SHOULD `return` beneath this line!\n}\n\nif err := saveUser(user); err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"Could not save user: %w\", err)\n}\n\nIf something goes wrong and err != nil in calling criticalDatabaseOperation(), we're not doing anything with the error aside from logging it! We might have data corruption or an otherwise unexpected issue that we are not handling intelligently, either via retrying the function call, canceling further program flow, or in worst-case scenario, shutting down the program. Go isn't magical and can't save you from these situations. Go only provides a standard approach for returning and using errors as values, but you still have to figure out how to handle the errors yourself.\nHow other languages do it: throwing exceptions\nIn something like the Javascript Node.js runtime, you can structure your programs as follows, known as throwing exceptions:\ntry {\n    criticalOperation1();\n    criticalOperation2();\n    criticalOperation3();\n} catch (e) {\n    console.error(e);\n}\n\nIf an error occurs in any of these functions, the stack trace for the error will pop up at runtime and will be logged to the console, but there is no explicit, programmatic handling of what went wrong.\nYour criticalOperation functions don't need to explicitly handle error flow, as any exception that occurs within that try block will be raised at runtime along with a stack trace of what went wrong.\nA benefit to exception-based languages is that, compared to Go, even an unhandled exception will still be raised via a stack trace at runtime if it occurs. In Go, it is possible to not handle a critical error at all, which can arguably be much worse. Go offers you full control of error handling, but also full responsibility.\nEDIT: Exceptions are definitely not the only way other languages deal with errors. Rust,  for example, has a good compromise of using option types and pattern matching to find error conditions, leveraging some nice syntactic sugar to achieve similar results.\nWhy Go doesn't use exceptions for error handling\nThe Zen of Go\nThe Zen of Go mentions two important proverbs:\n\nSimplicity matters\nPlan for failure, not success\n\nUsing the simple if err != nil snippet to all functions which return (value, error) helps ensure failure in your programs is thought of first and foremost. You don't need to wrangle with complicated, nested try catch blocks which appropriately handle all possible exceptions being raised.\nException-based code can often be opaque\nWith exception-based code, however, you're forced to be aware of every situation in which your code could have exceptions without actually handling them, as they'll be caught by your try catch blocks. That is, it encourages programmers to never check errors, knowing that at the very least, some exception will be handled automatically at runtime if it occurs.\nA function written in an exception-based programming language may often look like this:\nitem = getFromDB()\nitem.Value = 400\nsaveToDB(item)\nitem.Text = 'price changed'\n\nThis code does nothing to ensure exceptions are properly handled. Perhaps the difference between making the code above become aware of exceptions is to switch the order of saveToDB(item) and item.Text = 'price changed, which is opaque, hard to reason about, and can encourage some lazy programming habits. In functional programming jargon, this is known as the fancy term: violating referential transparency. This blog post from Microsoft's engineering blog in 2005 still holds true today, namely:\n\nMy point isn’t that exceptions are bad.\nMy point is that exceptions are too hard and I’m not smart\nenough to handle them.\n\nBenefits of Go's error syntax\nEasy creation of actionable error chains\nA superpower of the pattern if err != nil is how it allows for easy error-chains to traverse a program's hierarchy all the way to where they need to be handled. For example, a common Go error handled by a program's main function might read as follows:\n[2020-07-05-9:00] ERROR: Could not create user: could not check if user already exists in DB: could not establish database connection: no internet\nThe error above is (a) clear, (b) actionable, (c) has sufficient context as to what layers of the application went wrong. Instead of blowing up with an unreadable, cryptic stack trace, errors like these that are a result of factors we can add human-readable context to, and should be handled via clear error chains as shown above.\nMoreover, this type of error chain arises naturally as part of a standard Go program's structure, likely looking like this:\n// In controllers/user.go\nif err := db.CreateUser(user); err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"could not create user: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// In database/user.go\nfunc (db *Database) CreateUser(user *User) error {\n    ok, err := db.DoesUserExist(user)\n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"could not check if user already exists in db: %w\", err)\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (db *Database) DoesUserExist(user *User) error {\n    if err := db.Connected(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"could not establish db connection: %w\", err)\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (db *Database) Connected() error {\n    if !hasInternetConnection() {\n        return errors.New(\"no internet connection\")\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nThe beauty of the code above is that each of these errors are completely namespaced by their respective function, are informative, and only handle responsibility for what they are aware of. This sort of error chaining using fmt.Errorf(\"something went wrong: %w\", err) makes it trivial to build awesome error messages that can tell you exactly what went wrong based on how you defined it. \nOn top of this, if you want to also attach a stack trace to your functions, you can utilize the fantastic github.com/pkg/errors library, giving you functions such as:\nerrors.Wrapf(err, \"could not save user with email %s\", email)\n\nwhich print out a stack trace along with the human-readable error chain you created through your code. If I could summarize the most important pieces of advice I've received regarding writing idiomatic error handling in Go:\n\n\nAdd stack traces when your errors are actionable to developers\n\n\nDo something with your returned errors, don't just bubble them up to main, log them, and forget them\n\n\nKeep your error chains unambiguous\n\n\nWhen I write Go code, error handling is the one thing I never worry about, because errors themselves are a central aspect of every function I write, giving me full control in how I handle them safely, in a readable manner, and responsibly.\n\n\"if ...; err != nil\" is something you'll probably type if you write go. I don't think it's a plus or a negative. It gets the job done, it's easy to understand, and it empowers the programmer to do the right thing when the program fails. The rest is up to you.\n\n- From Hacker News\nKey Readings\n\nLeave if err != nil alone!\nGo pkg errors\n\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/why-go-error-handling-is-awesome/","title":"Why Go's Error Handling is Awesome"},"https://rauljordan.com/why-i-speak-cantonese/":{"body":"\nMany folks that know me personally know how much time I dedicate each day towards becoming proficient at speaking, reading, and writing Cantonese, making it my favorite language and one I have developed a major personal goal of becoming proficient in. Cantonese, known as jyut6 jyuh5 (粵話), is one of the major languages of China and the Chinese diaspora abroad, spoken by around 100 million native speakers [1] today along the pearl river delta in the southern Chinese province of Gwongdung (廣東), Macao, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia as a lingua franca. It is a language rich with tradition and a history spanning over 2000 years, retaining significant elements of Classical Chinese.\n\nBoth Cantonese and Mandarin use Chinese characters (中文字 zung1 man4 zi6) in their written form, allowing for a degree of correspondence between readers of the language. However, grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures differ significantly between the two, and the spoken languages themselves are completely mutually unintelligible. Although both languages are tonal, meaning the pitch of how a word is pronounced determines its meaning, Cantonese has 6 very important tones (with certain words having one of 3 additional tones, bringing the total number up to 9) while Mandarin only uses 4. Both languages also have almost completely different phonologies in terms of initials, finals, and syllables in general. Mandarin as the predominant language in mainland China, uses simplified characters in day to day written form, while Cantonese is written in traditional characters in daily communications. For example:\nCantonese\n你知唔知道佢哋喺邊度呀？leih5 zi1 m4 zi1 do1 keoi5 dei3 hai2 bin1 douh6 aa3? = Do you know where they are?\nMandarin\n你知道他们在哪里嗎？ni zhi dao ta men zai na li ma? = Do you know where they are?\nCantonese\n佢同佢講 keoi5 tuhng4 keoi5 gong2 = He/she told him/her\nMandarin\n他告訴她 ta gao su ta = He told her\nA mandarin speaker would understand the sentence \"佢而家喺邊度呀\" (keoi5 yi4 gaa1 hai2 bin1 douh6 aa, \"where is he right now\"?) as much as an english speaker would understand the spanish sentence \"donde esta el ahora?\" despite them being written in the same script / alphabet.\nNeedless to say, further regional differences, slang, and even cultural differences between different Cantonese speaking regions add even more flavor to the language itself, with Hong Kong speakers including British English influence in their day to day spoken Cantonese with words such as 士多啤梨 (si6 do1 be1 lei2, a phonetic translation of “strawberry”). The richness of cantonese culture manifests in not only in its historical precedents but also its wealth of cinema, music, and theatre. Film stars such as Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, and countless film stars + singers are all part of the Cantonese diaspora.\nCantonese today, unfortunately, is losing influence in mainland China due to pressures from the Chinese Communist Party to ensure language conformity across provinces, many seeing it as an attack on people’s identity and culture as it has been repeatedly dismissed as nothing more than a dialect by the government, disregarding its identity as the main spoken language in the daily life in southern China.\nMy significant other, mak6 gaa1 kei4 (麥嘉琪), a native and proud Cantonese speaker, intrigued me with its cultural identity ever since we started being together. The Cantonese language itself created a warm sense of community and belonging we noticed in every Chinatown we visited for its people and its visitors. For her, it is an irreplaceable identity that is tied so closely with her hometown, her food, her family, and other aspects which shape who she is. Language is our the primary medium of expression as human beings, and a native language encompasses an enormous part of a person’s true-self. I knew that I needed to study her language thoroughly if I ever wanted a chance at growing closer to her, and embarked on a lifelong learning journey since then.\nWe’ve spent a considerable amount of time in Gwongdung and HK, and felt incredibly welcome by the locals. Going places and starting casual conversations with people made them really appreciate sharing their culture. We went to countless caa4 lau6’s (茶樓), shared countless stories over dim2 sam1 (點心), and just overall felt a connection that was all tied together by the power of language. My favorite interaction was when her dad would frequently tell his friends or other locals: “我黎介紹下文龍，佢就識講白話，佢唔識講普通話!” (Let me introduce you to man6 lung4, he only speaks cantonese! He doesn’t know any mandarin 😃).\nAlthough learning any language is a daunting task which requires long-term discipline, learning a language so different than one’s own is especially challenging. Without the help of my awesome teacher from Hong Kong, Yuen louh5 si1, and practicing a daily vocabulary and traditional characters, I would be nowhere near the level today. I believe anyone can master the ~2500 characters required to be functionally literate in Cantonese, all it takes is a little push and to look forward to the end results.\nToday, we love visiting the different Chinatowns all across America as much as we can, finding new dim2 sam1 (點心) places anywhere we go. Seeing the smile on someone face that knew you took the time to learn their heritage, their language, and culture is priceless, and it makes learning any language truly worthwhile.\nI obviously have a very long way to go, but for now, when anyone asks me how my Cantonese is doing, my trusty response is “我仲學緊 :).\nFootnotes\n[1] https://www.cantonese.ca/intro.php\n","id":"https://rauljordan.com/why-i-speak-cantonese/","title":"Why I Speak Cantonese"}},"docInfo":{"https://rauljordan.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://rauljordan.com/about-me/":{"body":150,"title":0},"https://rauljordan.com/archive/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://rauljordan.com/building-a-service-registry-in-go/":{"body":905,"title":4},"https://rauljordan.com/custom-static-analysis-in-go-part-1/":{"body":1812,"title":5},"https://rauljordan.com/go-lessons-from-writing-a-serialization-library-for-ethereum/":{"body":3975,"title":6},"https://rauljordan.com/how-i-accurately-predicted-loan-payments-on-the-lendingclub-dataset/":{"body":871,"title":6},"https://rauljordan.com/how-my-team-won-the-facebook-graphql-hackathon/":{"body":1400,"title":5},"https://rauljordan.com/how-to-setup-a-proof-of-stake-devnet/":{"body":1085,"title":7},"https://rauljordan.com/how-to-write-an-event-feed-library/":{"body":2929,"title":7},"https://rauljordan.com/immutability-patterns-in-go/":{"body":1342,"title":3},"https://rauljordan.com/key-takeaways-from-a-harvard-education/":{"body":1951,"title":5},"https://rauljordan.com/my-most-embarrassing-story-as-a-beginner-software-engineer/":{"body":517,"title":5},"https://rauljordan.com/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://rauljordan.com/reuse-expensive-computation-with-in-progress-caches/":{"body":830,"title":6},"https://rauljordan.com/rust-concepts-i-wish-i-learned-earlier/":{"body":2948,"title":5},"https://rauljordan.com/using-interface-composition-in-go-as-guardrails/":{"body":553,"title":5},"https://rauljordan.com/when-a-solution-is-right-in-front-of-your-eyes/":{"body":1132,"title":3},"https://rauljordan.com/when-years-of-work-materialize/":{"body":133,"title":4},"https://rauljordan.com/why-go-error-handling-is-awesome/":{"body":890,"title":4},"https://rauljordan.com/why-i-speak-cantonese/":{"body":543,"title":2}},"length":21},"lang":"English"};
